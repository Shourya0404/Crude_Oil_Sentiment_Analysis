The Unintended Consequences Of Fossil Fuel Divestment.html,"The stability of the global oil market is under threat. The impact of COVID-19 and the resultant demand destruction has put an ever-increasing amount of oil and gas producers on the path to bankruptcy. At present, the list of U.S. shale oil and gas producers filing for Chapter 11 is growing by the day, while global oilfield services and offshore drilling companies are fighting to survive. Ultimately, this very dire situation is being driven by oil and gas demand and prices, which is why a degree of stability has returned with oil prices back around the $40 mark.  But there is another variable beyond just supply and demand that is now threatening to reintroduce instability to markets. Fossil Fuel Divestment, supported by international governments, international financial institutions, and investors is now threatening to push oil and gas companies into the abyss. In recent weeks, a group of 12 major cities in the EU, USA, and Africa, all pledged to divest from coal, oil, and gas. These cities are home to more than 36 million residents and hold over $295 billion in assets. Led by London and New York City, they have decided to divest from the fossil fuel assets that they directly control and have called on the pension funds managing their money to do the same. The other cities joining the divestment declaration are Berlin, Bristol, Cape Town, Durban, Los Angeles, Milan, New Orleans, Oslo, Pittsburgh, and Vancouver.  Activist investors, in-line with the growing Western media onslaught on hydrocarbon production and use, are putting not only the future of international oil and gas producers at risk but increasingly removing the necessary equilibrium between independent (privately owned) oil and gas producers and the national oil companies. For decades, global oil and gas production has been built on several mainstream structures, including the Texas Railroad Commission, Seven Sisters, and OPEC. These structures have helped to stabilize and structure the market to benefit producers, shareholders, and consumers at the same time. The power balance between the Seven Sisters (which in its modern form consists of Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, and Chevron) and OPEC producers has regulated the $1.7-1.8 trillion oil market through times of financial crisis, regional wars, and Black Swan events. This necessary cooperation or power equilibrium is now being undermined by investors and politicians, threatening not only energy and petroleum product supply to global markets but also diminishing the influence of consumer countries on producers, such as OPEC.  An increasing amount of international financial giants, such as Dutch asset manager Robeco, are committed to excluding investments in thermal coal, oil sands, and Arctic drilling from all its mutual funds. The Dutch fund stated this week that it will bar companies that derive 25% or more of their revenues from thermal coal or oil sands, or 10% or more from Arctic drilling. The Dutch asset manager, holding around 155 billion euros ($181 billion), has already excluded thermal coal investment from its sustainable funds.

Robeco’s move follows a growing list of European insurers and asset managers that have cut investments in fossil fuels, including Dutch insurer Aegon. Robeco said it would complete the exclusion of fossil fuel firms by the end of this year. European insurers, asset managers, and pension funds are not the only ones. Recent reports indicate that global investors have already excluded $5.4 trillion from fossil fuels.  The main driver behind this divestment craze is a determination to remove man-made greenhouse gas emissions in order to counter climate change. Reports indicate that 80% of all global emissions come from fossil fuels. To reach the goals set out by governments, emissions need to be cut by two-thirds, or fossil fuel production has to be cut by 1% per year through to 2050. Fossil fuel production has seen a growth of 2% per year in the last 30 years.  In the eyes of most investors and activists/governments, divesting in fossil fuel companies will be a major step forward. Some investors are arguing that it is economically sensible to divest based on the stranded asset argument put forward in a major report from the Bank of England. Bank, equity and pension funds are worried that the intrinsic value of fossil fuel assets is much lower than current market valuations.  The issue with that argument is that risks are not being taken into account by most investors and politicians. Even if the total value of hydrocarbon producers on stock exchanges has dwindled, the impact of divestment on asset allocation and returns will be immense. Fossil fuel producers make up around 6% of the global stock market and over 12% of the UK market. As some have already stated, excluding an entire sector impacts asset allocation, resulting in increased benchmark risk (relative to the market) and potentially higher volatility.  Investment bank Schroders research shows that over the long-term the impact of exclusions on investment returns is minimal. However, it can increase volatility in the short term.

In recent weeks, statements by BP and Shell that they want to move part of their investments from upstream oil and gas to green have been met with plenty of positive reactions from the media, but the announcements should really give observes reason to worry. Going green is putting market stability at risk. Assessments about the major asset re-evaluations by privately-owned oil companies in recent months should be taken with a grain of salt. Even if the world’s biggest oil companies were to slash the value of reserves and current projects in 2020, such as French major Total writing down about $7 billion of Canadian oil sands assets, or Shell’s $4.7 billion hit in the second quarter relating to assets in North America, Brazil, and Europe and a project in Nigeria, the real value is a book value. At times of crisis and uncertainty, it is always attractive to take impairments. Even Exxon Mobil warned in August that low energy prices may wipe out as much as one-fifth of its oil and natural gas reserves. Not only do shareholders feel the pain of lower revenues and dividends in times like these, but hydrocarbon projects become uneconomical. By removing multibillion-dollar hydrocarbon investment projects around the world though, supply will be hit hard in the coming years while demand will continue to grow. Renewable projects are only able to counter the growing demand for energy, not for products. It should be worrying that IOCs, such as Shell or BP are not only divesting part of their global oil and gas acreage and projects but also stopping exploration for new acreage. If oil and gas markets are destabilized further, it will be left to NOCs to save the market. Clean energy analysts seem to have failed to understand that the stranded assets of IOCs are assets ripe for others. Profit margins, dividends, and activist shareholders are not such an issue for Aramco, ADNOC, NNPC, Gazprom, or CNOOC. With lower supply in the coming years, and demand likely to return, prices will increase and margins will go up. This will make the growing list of so-called stranded assets commercially attractive again. But this time they will likely fall into the hands of NOCs rather than IOCs.  The future of IOCs and independents is not looking very promising. Lack of access to financial markets and a political-societal drive to block hydrocarbon projects makes some of the world’s largest oil firms look like pension funds or even graveyard construction companies. The future for NOCs, especially the OPEC+ parties, however, is bright. Without activist shareholders to worry about, easy access to financial markets, and SWFs, NOCs are not only able to reap the rewards of the current onslaught, they are also willing. For NOCs there are no stranded assets, every drop of resource can and will be produced and used, as it is part of their national identity. For Western and Asian consumers, however, it will mean that their politicians and companies will need to deal with the new hydrocarbon powers. Dealing with Shell or BP on a European government level is easy. To deal with a NOC, supported by its respective national government, is of a far more complex question.  Regulating the market in the future will be a real headache for consumers.",0.1155,positive
Mexicos Crude Oil Future Is In Jeopardy.html,"The attentive reader might have come across numerous articles about Mexico’s numerous discoveries in the past months. Heavily indebted, mired in a myriad of corruption cases and facing the prospects of terminal (albeit gradual) output decline – Mexico in general and PEMEX in particular needs positive market stories that it can embrace as its narrative, a version of its future that does not necessarily mean to obsolescence. Yet upon closer inspection, much of the articulated narrative might seem rather counterintuitive. If anything, Mexico’s future seems to be tilting towards natural gas and light sweet crude, moreover, its future would be tangibly hit should foreign drillers be limited in their possibilities.  The pre-election pledges of President Lopez Obrador to increase Mexican crude production to 2.6mbpd by 2024 have so far remained a pipe dream, seemingly everything contributed to the opposite recently. On the other hand, participating in the OPEC+ cuts has cooled the narrative of Mexico’s continuously decline, now PEMEX’s production has been stagnating at 1.67mbpd (the average of Q2 2020 volumes) despite recurring bad weather conditions like the Cristobal and Amanda tropical storms that have brought about a series of field shut-ins. Interestingly, Mexico remains a participant to the OPEC+ agreement concluded in March 2020 when It promised to cut output by 100kbpd to 1.686mbpd – meaning that Mexican producers have underperformed the quota by almost 20 000 barrels per day.  Mexico’s exports, however, have been experiencing a much more significant downward slide. The crux of the matter lies in AMLO’s pledge to maximize domestic refinery output whilst bringing light crude imports from the United States to a halt. For this reason, PEMEX is building the 340kbpd Dos Bocas Refinery aiming to keep Mexico’s flagship crude Maya at home. This in itself will decrease Mexico’s exports in the post-2023 horizon, so not only are PEMEX’s current export volumes jeopardized by the ongoing corona virus nightmare and the investment curtailments that it has entailed, there will most probably be no rebound for the better. This is an especially noteworthy development for US refiners as Mexico’s other grades (Isthmus, Olmeca) have all but disappeared from the American market and Maya remains the only major stream.

 Expectedly, the COVID-19 market slump has left an indelible mark on Mexico’s upstream segment, too. Of the 19 exploration wells that the National Hydrocarbon Commission (CNH) approved in Q2 2020, only 11 were drilled and just 5 resulted in discoveries. PEMEX remains the main driller in the country as 60% exploration wells and 96% of production wells were spudded by the national oil company. Concurrently to cutting exploration wells, PEMEX has cut back on using private drilling rigs – according to media reports the total number that they have renounced on stand at 76. Interestingly, Mexico’s legacy fields Ku-Maloob-Zaap and Cantarell will also suffer the fate of many other offshore fields.  Graph 2. Operating oil wells in Mexico in 2017-2020.  Source: CNH.  New discoveries might provide some momentum for Mexico in general, despite their relatively low number is Q2 2020 (a mere 3 fields were certified by CNH). Ironically, the two larger finds – Polok with estimated crude reserves of 187MMbbls and Chinwol with 88MMbls – were drilled by Repsol and its partners (PTTEP, Petronas and Wintershall Dea) in Mexico’s deepwater block 29 which was previously undrilled and untapped. PEMEX has had one discovery which despite wielding crude of remarkable quality (43° API for a shallow-water Tabasco find is really noteworthy) is only assessed at 32MMbbls of recoverable reserves. On the other hand, it has to be noted that PEMEX’s recent Ixachi gas/condensate discovery remains Mexico’s hottest gas prospect as the NOC pushes forward with its plan to drill a total of 47 wells at the site, with a view to swiftly bring gas output to a plateau level of 639 MMCf/day (6.6 BCm per year).

 Mexico’s oil industry continues to be torn apart by the ongoing PEMEX court hearings whereby the former CEO of PEMEX Emilio Lozoya accused Enrique Peña Nieto (President of Mexico in 2012-2018) and his government of using the Mexican national oil company as a tool for the surreptitious bribing of national MPs. Initially an investigation into the dealings of Lozoya himself, focusing primarily on his dealings with Brazil’s Odebrecht, the case has grown into a national soap opera with implications for most of Mexico’s top officials in the Pena Nieto administration, coming in very timely for President Lopez Obrador who might use it concurrently as a national distraction amid an ever-worsening coronavirus pandemic and as proof that his long-standing opposition to Mexico’s 2014 energy reform has always been spot on.  Unfortunately for Mexico, the AMLO administration has found no other way out of the current quagmire than to seek a “strengthening of PEMEX”. Concurrently to the Lozoya case and the issue of structural corruption within PEMEX, President Lopez Obrador might trigger another long-running dispute: having flaunted the possibility of revising Mexico’s 2014 energy reform both legislatively and constitutionally. Looking at PEMEX’s current profitability numbers (in H1 2020 the Mexican NOC has generated a whopping $26 billion loss, of which $24 billion was booked in the first quarter) it seems rather disingenuous to claim that the state tightening its ties to PEMEX has reversed the crash course that the NOC remains at. To provide just one illustration of PEMEX’s woes - Its total financial debt tally already stands at $107 billion. All things considered, one thing is almost certain: against all the difficulties and challenges PEMEX has been and will potentially face, it would be a miracle if AMLO’s vows of resurrecting crude production work out. The government seems to understand this, otherwise it wouldn’t have already introduced several amendments into Mexico’s 2021 budget proposal. The 2021 production target stands at 1.86mbpd whilst the 2024 “main” AMLO objective was lowered from 2.6mbpd to 2.28mbpd. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic might serve a very useful explanation as to why Mexico underperformed, once again, its ambitious objectives and if politically expedient just pass over the profound structural issues that will continue to hamper its oil prospects.",0.9165,positive
Can Algeria Keep Its Oil Exports From Falling Further.html,"Algeria has struggled to keep up with its manifold challenges throughout this year – still trying to clear the rubble of the Bouteflika regime, it continuously needs to placate an ever-demanding populace while COVID-19 is draining the country’s budget,and as OPEC+ oil production cuts brought total output levels to multi-year lows. Yet difficult periods might also serve as stepping-stones for future success and Algeria’s current difficulties might finally mobilize its political elites to embrace much-needed change. Algeria holds this year’s rotating presidency at OPEC as well as that of the Gas Exporting Countries’ Forum meaning its new narrative will be heard and assessed thoroughly, so should its reformist drive survive the frenzy of 2020-2021, it can lay the foundations of the North African nation’s oil renaissance.  The main tenet of Algeria’s post-Bouteflika energy policy lies in the necessity to revisit its legislative base. This being said it might come as a bit of surprise that one of the key challenges the new Algerian government had to overcome was in forcing the hydrocarbon law through the government. Even though the new hydrocarbon bill was approved by the Ministers’ Council in October 2019, it took Algerian authorities almost a year to actually publish the law. Based on Energy Minister Abdelmadjid Attar’s utterances late August, the 43 implementing rules that make up the new law were broken up into 3 batches and will be published by the general government secretariat in September, October and November/December. Attar himself was nominated for the position in June and has made the finalization of the hydrocarbon bill one of his main policy objectives. At the time of the Hydrocarbon bill’s adoption, Algiers was rather wary of the populace reacting angrily to the liberalization, albeit very prudent, of the oil industry. The overall timing seems to be much better nowadays, as Algeria’s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune fixing the date on another of the government’s main agenda points, if not the most important one – holding a referendum on a new constitution. The referendum will be held November 01 and at first glimpse bears no direct relation to the sphere of hydrocarbons – the draft Constitution is intended to delineate the legislative branch from the executive so that the latter cannot force its way back again onto the former. For oil and gas, the adoption of the Constitution would be beneficial as it would boost the internal stature of the politically moderate reformist powers that currently wield the most control over Algeria.  The reformist movement has already articulated its view on required long-term directions in Algerian upstream. First of all, it emphasizes the necessity to have the new hydrocarbon law enacted as soon as possible to act straightaway upon the investors’ interest. Second, both the national oil company Sonatrach and its current/future partners should focus on increasing the oil recovery factor in Algerian assets. Third, encourage the participation of external consultants in assessing Algeria’s untapped potential so as to free up Sonatrach from this task. Fourth, have Sonatrach concentrate on the petrochemical sector so that Algeria can garner even more value from every barrel it produces. Last but not least, renewables should supplant Algeria’s hydrocarbons wherever possible, be it at the fields’ themselves or in feeding the Algerian grid with green electricity.  
 Related: World’s No.1 Oil Trader Sees Crude Inventories Shrinking This Year Obviously enough, there is a clearly palpable reason why such proactive measures are needed now. Exports are down, moreover, as with other African oil-producing nations, drilling in Algeria has taken quite a hit from the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Usually Algeria would have 90-110 exploratory drilling wells drilled every year, most of them (some 85-90%) spudded by the national oil company. This year, however, the aggregate annual tally of exploratory wells will barely surpass 50 on the back of sizeable CAPEX cuts in the upstream sector. Development drilling is also bound to suffer, despite the positive momentum it had prior to the corona virus – 185 development wells were spudded in 2019, some 30 of them in cooperation with international majors.  IMF assesses Algeria’s breakeven crude price at 157.2 USD per barrel, therefore it should not surprise anyone that Algeria remains a staunch believer in joint OPEC+ action to push up prices again. Under the deal, Algeria capped its May-July production at 816kbpd, moving on to 864kbpd in the August-December 2020 timeframe. The double whammy of OPEC+ and the slashing of capital and operational expenses in the upstream sector has also entailed an array of immediate consequences, most notably decreasing crude exports. Crude exports oscillated in the June-August 2020 period between 0.25-0.3mbpd, beating multi-year highs, effectively halving from the average level of the past year (0.55mpbd, see Graph 1).  Graph 1. Algerian Crude Exports in 2017-2020 and Major Export Outlets (million barrels per day). 
 Source: Thomson Reuters.  Yet future constraints and potential bottlenecks extend beyond the realm of oil – just last month the Algerian Energy Ministry has sounded the tocsin on the nation’s future gas exports, namely that against the background of ever-increasing domestic demand Algeria’s current level of exports (stood at 41 BCm in 2019, including both LNG and piped gas) are plainly untenable. The inevitable decline is a long time in the making, what is new, however, is that exports might drop to 25-30 BCm per year by 2025 already, i.e. 5 years earlier than initially expected. This put Algeria’s gas industry under substantial stress given that almost every single long-term commitment Sonatrach has vis-à-vis its Italian and Spanish buyers was recently prolonged, at the same time the oft-flaunted Algerian shale gale is still yet to start up. ",-0.9748,negative
Biden Fracking Ban Could Cripple New Mexicos Oil Industry.html,"Oil workers in New Mexico fear they will lose their jobs and oil companies are rushing to secure drilling permits on federal lands ahead of the presidential election, which could result in Joe Biden winning who has promised to immediately ban new fracking on federal lands.  Many of the sweetest spots in the Permian left for drillers to profitably drill at $40 a barrel oil are located on the New Mexico side of the Permian. But most of New Mexico’s oil and gas production takes place on federal land, unlike in Texas.   Biden is not banning fracking overall, but he has said that he would move to ban new fracking activities on federal land.  Fracking on federal land is just 10 percent of the total U.S. fracking industry, but for New Mexico, it’s much more—65 percent of the state’s oil and gas production takes place on federal land, according to Reuters estimates. 
 The possibility of a Biden win in November has had many companies operating in New Mexico proactively securing months, and even years, worth of drilling permits on federal land before the election.   For the oil workers, a Biden win would mean fewer jobs – “It scares the heck out of us,” Jim Mayes, a foreman at S&J Contractors, told Bloomberg.  The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API) released earlier this month a new analysis warning that New Mexico would be among the states hardest hit by the proposal to ban federal land leases. New Mexico would lose over 62,000 jobs by 2022, according to the analysis.  “With nearly 40 percent of the state’s budget funded by natural gas and oil production, a ban could put at risk more than $1 billion of federal revenue sharing which helps support New Mexico’s education and conservation programs,” API and NMOGA said.

Texas oil and gas executives have a lot on their minds right now, but their worst fear for the next twelve months is neither the recession nor the pandemic—it’s the possibility that President Biden will win the White House. According to a recent survey of the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs among members of the Texas Oil and Gas Association (TXOGA), 76 percent of oil and gas executives in Texas say that the election of Joe Biden is the top threat to the economic well-being of their companies.",-0.8726,negative
Is Iraq Turning Its Back On The OPEC Deal.html,,0.0,neutral
OPEC In Trouble As Oil Outlook Worsens.html,"Just when they thought they had rebalanced the oil market, OPEC members were served an unpleasant surprise from exempted fellow Libya. The country’s warring factions reached a ceasefire, and some long-shuttered oil ports have been reopened, along with the fields that feed them. By the end of the month, the National Oil Corporation plans to boost the average daily output of the nation from less than 100,000 bpd to 260,000 bpd. Meanwhile, OPEC+ has relaxed its production cuts by 2 million bpd.  The market, according to Mercuria chief executive Marco Dunand, cannot handle this. In an interview for Bloomberg, Dunand said demand was still weaker than previously expected, and any additional oil flowing into markets would fail to be absorbed. This means a looming build in floating storage as this month, global inventories rose by between 500,000 bpd and 1 million bpd—and that’s excluding the Libyan restart— while drawdowns over the final quarter were seen at 1 million bpd. In his bearish outlook for the immediate term, Mercuria’s head is in sync with the head of another commodity trading major, Trafigura. The third super trader, however, is surprisingly optimistic. Also in an interview with Bloomberg, Vitol’s chief executive said earlier this month he expected global crude oil inventories to shrink considerably by the end of the year. While both the heads of Trafigura and Mercuria expect stocks to build first before starting to decline, Vitol’s chief said he expected a drawdown of some 250-300 million barrels by the end of the year. Reports emerged earlier this month that commodity traders—including the Big Three—were chartering more tankers to store crude oil offshore, sparking concern we could see something like a repeat of this spring when hundreds of millions of barrels of unsellable oil had to be dumped on tankers because onshore storage was full. After the lockdowns ended, demand began improving. This moderate demand boost, however, fell short of pretty much all expectations.
  Related: Natural Gas Prices Explode On Stronger Demand One particularly worrying trend is the slow rate of economic recovery among emerging countries—the main drivers of oil demand growth. Except for China, most are still battling the coronavirus and its effects on their economies. India is a good case in point: its oil demand is seen to be the worst affected by the coronavirus as the country itself suffers the second-highest total case count in the world. Some analysts believe, however, that demand in China is about to start slowing down soon. It will be a long-term trend, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, and a result not just of Covid-19 but of Beijing’s emission-reduction goals. Over the next 20 years, the energy research organization said, China’s oil demand was likely to grow at an annual pace of 3 to 4 million bpd, after growing by double-digit rates in the past few years. According to Mercuria’s Dunand, oil demand during the fourth quarter will average 95 million bpd. That’s down from a market consensus of 97 to 98 million bpd, made in spring. And the rate at which excessive inventories will be drawn is seen weaker than previously expected. Add to this a dramatic build in diesel inventories because refiners, Dunand noted to Bloomberg, are dumping jet fuel into the diesel pool, and Libya’s restart of production and the outlook for prices once again becomes grim. 
 According to the head of Mercuria, the biggest problem on the oil market is the diesel stock oversupply. With many countries in Europe restricting movement again, whatever improvement there had been in fuel demand—especially jet fuel—will likely slow down further now, if not reverse if a full-blown second wave of infections hits the continent. And the problem will persist. Meanwhile, OPEC is out of options. The cartel and its partners in OPEC+ will discuss the next steps later this year, with the original plan involving a further relaxation of the cuts, by 2 million bpd, from January 2021. The way prices are moving now and likely to move during the final quarter, this may become a topic of arguments within the group, as some members need oil revenues more urgently than others.",-0.9637,negative
How The Oil Crash Solved The Permian Pipeline Problem.html,"While Permian oil and gas production was soaring in 2018, U.S. midstream operators were planning and building pipeline takeaway capacity, expecting that the largest U.S. shale play would increase output for years to come, even if at a slower pace than before. Pipeline companies rushed to invest in and complete new oil pipelines in the region to stay ahead of the booming Permian production. But they got ahead of themselves in boosting pipeline takeaway capacity.  The black swan year of 2020 exposed the stark reality of the shale and pipeline construction boom. Current pipeline capacity in the Permian is exceeding production so much that in a year or two, when pipelines currently under construction are completed, Permian producers could find themselves using just half of the available takeaway infrastructure, according to analysts. Pipeline Overbuild Granted, oil pipeline infrastructure was already running ahead of Permian production at the end of last year, when output growth slowed down with many producers prioritizing profits over production as the capital markets and investors soured on footing the bill for explosive output growth without meaningful returns. Then came the pandemic and the price crash in March 2020, forcing Permian exploration and production companies to curtail production, which has dropped from nearly 5 million barrels per day (bpd) as of March to an estimated 4.150 million bpd in September—a drop of around 700,000 bpd over the six months since oil prices collapsed. After the crash, pipeline infrastructure companies started to announce deferrals of final investment decisions and start-up dates for planned oil and gas pipelines, especially in the Permian, which suddenly found itself with additional overbuild of capacity as production and consumption of oil struggled to recover from the pandemic-driven crisis. 
 The latest announcement of a canceled oil pipeline came from Enterprise Products Partners, which said earlier this month that it was scrapping the 450,000 barrels per day Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline project. But many of the pipelines planned back in 2018 are already in service and capacity was already exceeding production even if project deferrals and cancellations are taken into account.  Related: U.S. Oil Exports Continue To Decline “Permian oil infrastructure is already overbuilt. We anticipate that Permian oil output will recover to pre-COVID records of 4.9 million B/D by the end of the next year, but, even then, we will have 2 million B/D of unutilized outbound capacity,” Rystad Energy’s head of shale research Artem Abramov told the Journal of Petroleum Technology earlier this month. Permian Crude Pipelines Face Years Of Low Utilization According to midstream sector analytics company East Daley Capital, while the cancellation of Midland-to-ECHO 4 removes 450,000 bpd of future takeaway capacity from the Permian, this is just a small step in addressing a looming oversupply of the basin’s egress capacity. Currently, Permian crude oil supply is just over 4 million bpd, while the takeaway capacity exceeds 7 million bpd. By early 2021, crude oil pipeline capacity is set to jump to 8.3 million bpd, which would be double the production in the Permian, East Daley’s estimates reported by The Wall Street Journal show. According to Wood Mackenzie, long-haul crude oil pipelines between the Permian and the U.S. Gulf Coast were overbuilt even before this year’s price crash. Pipeline utilization in the biggest American shale basin is set to fall to 60 percent by October 2020, and stay at around that level until at least December 2021, Alex Beeker, WoodMac’s Principal Analyst, Corporate Research, said in June.
 Oil Crisis Spills To All Sectors The crash in oil prices and shale production spilled over to the midstream sector, which is now caught between falling oil production and pipeline utilization from the upstream and crumbling demand for fuels in the downstream. The midstream sector is reducing capex and deferring some pipeline projects, while analysts and industry executives say that the industry is set for a wave of consolidation with increased competition and weakened financial profiles of some operators.  Related: Natural Gas Prices Jump Again On Smaller-Than-Forecast Stock Build Oil producers and oil infrastructure developers in the Permian – as well as everyone in the world – were taken by surprise in a “global pandemic that would substantially slow economic activity in much of the industrialized world, especially the U.S.; annihilate demand for jet fuel, motor gasoline, and (to a lesser degree) diesel; and spur the U.S. refinery sector to reduce their utilization rates to less than 70%,” RBN Energy said this month. New pipelines, production curtailments, changed forecasts, and reduced capex by producers have “significantly altered crude oil and natural gas market fundamentals,” in the Permian, RBN Energy added. The excess Permian pipeline capacity has helped raise the price of oil in Midland, Texas, to the levels of the WTI traded in Cushing, closing the double-digit dollar discount of Midland oil from early 2018 when crude takeaway capacity in the Permian was severely constrained. These days, producers who don’t have contracts to ship their crude at fixed prices could sell their Permian crude at prices similar to the U.S. benchmark. This could be some, but not enough, consolation for producers, considering that WTI Crude is struggling to hold onto the $40 a barrel handle these days.  For refiners along the Gulf Coast, gone are the days of Permian oil significantly cheaper than WTI Crude. The more expensive Permian crude for processing only adds to refiners’ biggest distress these days—the crash in fuel demand.      ",-0.9985,negative
ConocoPhilips Oil Demand Will Return And Grow.html,"ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) is the latest to issue forward-looking statements regarding the global oil demand forecast, stating that global oil demand would indeed return to 100 million barrels per day—and keep growing from there, according to Reuters. Next year, however, ConocoPhillips expects “quite a bit of uncertainty next year,” according to Senior Vice President Dominic Macklon, who was answering questions with Raymond James. This projection on global oil demand is different than BP’s, who sees the coronavirus pandemic having a long-term effect on oil demand, compounded by climate concerns, and that oil demand may never again recover to those seen in 2019.  
 It is, however, in line with Gazprom Neft’s projections, which sees full oil demand recovery by the end of next year. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak had an even rosier outlook, seeing oil demand recovering fully by the second quarter of next year. OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA), however, have more pessimistic views of global oil demand, with both stating that they do not expect that global oil demand will ever fully recover from being crushed by the coronavirus pandemic. “The path ahead is treacherous,” the IEA said in its latest oulook, adding that the market outlook was “even more fragile” than expected.
 Macklon sees U.S. shale output falling by 4 million barrels per day in 2022. For Conoco specifically, it sees next year’s capital spending as below what it had planned to spend this year, which was $6.6 billion. Conoco has not joined its peers in laying off staff, but it had halted all fracking crews amid the pandemic. It is in the process of returning two of those fracking crews back into the field, Macklon has said.",-0.6805,negative
Will New Zealand Close Its Last Oil Refinery.html,"The 2nd wave of COVID-19/20 becoming an irreversible part of our reality, the global downstream sector has started to assess the damage done so far and the potential detriment that is still up there for refiners that are struggling to remain profitable. According to IEA estimates, it will take at least 2 years until the refining sector recovers fully from the ramifications of the current demand loss. With refinery utilization rates expected to drop to an annual average of 72% this year and 77% in 2021, the lowest since 1983, it should come as no surprise that some downstream firms are considering closing down altogether. New Zealand might not be a refining giant when compared to Asian downstream powerhouses, yet a potential closure would most probably leave a significant impact across Asia and Oceania. The closure of Marsden Point would not be a novelty for the Asia Pacific Region. Shell has already announced the definitive closure of the 110kbpd Tabangao Refinery in the Philippines after 60 years of continuous operation. Shell would still have another plant operating in the East Asian country, still the sudden COVID-induced closure (the refinery stopped refining in May and was halted for good thereafter) goes on to demonstrate the overall decreased profitability of refining in the region. Asia seems to be confronting its “Europe moment” when excessive refining capacity engenders the closure of the least profitable assets. Tabangao would be gradually converted into a fuel import terminal, paving a way forward for other refineries, too. Rumours have been circulating that some Australian and Japanese refineries are also considering their options. Where does all this leave New Zealand? Since May-June 2020 the 135kbpd Marsden Point Refinery was reported to consider transforming the plant into a storage terminal that would serve as a distribution hub for imported products. The decision is far from being finalized as many shareholders have not had their say on the refinery’s future. The main shareholders did indicate their strategic intentions though, tilting heavily towards the closure option. The largest shareholder ExxonMobil (owns 17.2%) continues to “assess the closures’s implications for its business”, the second-largest Z Energy (15.36%) has publicly and unequivocally advocated for the transformation of Marsden Point whilst the third-largest shareholder BP voiced its “support” for the refinery’s strategic review of operations. Whilst New Zealand political scene has been replete with deliberations on the timeliness and social consequences (some 1100 jobs lost) of a potential Marsden Point closure, the refinery itself was compelled to minimize its output and operational exposure vis-à-vis the coronavirus pandemics. In COVID-19 times New Zealand has cut down massively on its refining in general, with demand waning as early as March/April the worst came in July 2020 which has seen no crude imports whatsoever, for the first time in this millennium. In fact, the last time when New Zealand bought no crude on a monthly basis was in August 1986. It has to be pointed out that were Marsden Point to be decommissioned, the infrastructure connecting the refinery to the North Island’s main consumption hubs remain intact, such as the 104-mile Refinery-Auckland Pipeline (RAP).

 Graph 1. New Zealand’s Crude Imports in 2017-2020 (‘000 barrels per day).  Source: Thomson Reuters. Although New Zealand also imports products as the Marsden Point Refinery is not producing enough to cover the nation’s needs (40% of its gasoline and some 30% of its Diesel are imported from elsewhere), shutting down the nation’s only oil-refining asset might render it politically and economically vulnerable. Hence, there are also other alternative way that might apply to the refinery’s future – the company’s top management flaunted the idea of simply improving the firm’s refining economics and altering its current business model, without any damage done or constraints stipulated to its assets. Yet judging by todays’ utterances, the stakeholders would rather scrap it whilst it still generates some money, so as not to invest in unnecessary equipment upgrades that would never be requited financially.
 New Zealand’s upstream segment would not suffer that much from closing down the nation’s sole refinery. Producing some 140kbpd of crude oil and condensate, with the Pohokura and Maari fields providing almost half of the total output, New Zealand’s light and sweet grades have traditionally been exported to Australia. Were New Zealand to quit the downstream industry altogether, the main sufferers in terms of lost market outlets would be Middle Eastern producers – the Emirati Murban has been the all-time favorite, with at least one Aframax cargo arrival per month (see Graph 1). Such preference stems from the fact that since its inception Marsden Point was configured to refine medium sour crudes and not the light domestic types. If the fate of Australia is anything to go by, the future for New Zealand refining is dire. Australia has had 4 out of its initial 8 refineries closed in the past 11 years and doubts remain over the long-term viability of Caltex Australia’s 109kbpd Lytton Refinery. The decommissioned refineries in Adelaide and Sydney, Brisbane and potentially Marsden Point have a similar historical course. At first low margins have disbalanced their financial stature and then giant East Asian refineries have simply steamrolled them thanks to a combination of implicit government subsidies and other sweeteners. In 2019 Marsden Point was still profitable, despite generating a mere $4.2 million of annual net profit, however this year’s numbers are going to be lamentable. The market knows this - dropping to $0.6 per share, Refining NZ’s stock shares have lost two-thirds of their value when compared to January 2020.",-0.6883,negative
Maintaining Oil Production Is The Top Priority For US Drillers.html,"Maintaining oil production will be the top priority for U.S. oil drillers for the next six months, according to the latest installment of the Dallas Fed quarterly energy survey. According to it, 19 percent—the biggest portion of respondents—were most focused on keeping production at current levels. Production growth, on the other hand, is a top priority for 16 percent, the survey found. That’s the same percentage as respondents who said their top priority is reducing debt. Another 16 percent said their top priority for the next six months was finding additional sources of capital.
 Interestingly enough, divestiture was the least popular top priority: less than 8 percent of respondents prioritized that. Cost reduction was the top priority for 8 percent, and asset acquisition was the top priority for 12 percent of the respondents in the survey. In oilfield services, the priority picture was different. Close to a third of the respondents from this segment said their top priority for the next six months was growing their business, with slightly less prioritizing the keeping of business activity at current levels. Cost reduction came next, with some 10 percent of respondents noting it as their top priority. Debt reduction was an option picked by less than 10 percent.
 Another highlight from the latest Dallas Fed survey is the finding that the majority of oil executives believed U.S. oil production has peaked. As much as two-thirds of respondents shared this belief. An even larger majority thought that OPEC will come to play a more prominent role in determining oil prices going forward. Some 74 percent of respondents shared this belief. Speaking of prices, it seems like it will be a while yet before the U.S. rig count begins to increase meaningfully. According to 43 percent of Dallas Fed survey respondents, the rig count would only increase substantially when WTI reaches $51-55 a barrel. Another 29 percent believed the rig count will start rising steadily when WTI reached $56-60, and only 11 believed drillers would start adding rigs at WTI prices of below $50 a barrel.",0.9875,positive
Africa Is The Undeniable Final Frontier For Oil.html,"The pandemic has been devastating for the oil industry globally. Explorers suspended drilling, producers, idled wells, Big Oil majors put up assets for sale. But the world continues to need oil, albeit lower amounts of it than a year ago, and it will continue to need it. Exploration is not dead. It is especially not dead in Africa—a hot spot in oil and gas before the pandemic. The East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline Earlier this month, French Total and the Uganda government signed an important deal, for the construction of a pipeline that will carry Ugandan oil to the Kenyan coast. Two weeks later, the presidents of the two countries signed their own deal about the $3.5-billion infrastructure. The final investment decision on the pipeline is expected by the end of the year in a rare good sign about the future of oil demand. Uganda and Kenya are both newcomers on the oil scene with hopes to join the oil exporting community soon. If the construction of a $3.5-billion oil pipeline still makes economic sense for countries that are not among the wealthiest in the world, there may be some hope for oil demand. The South African oil discovery Africa Energy, a Canadian exploration company, said last week it expected to strike a lot of oil in an offshore block in South Africa with reserves that could exceed those of an earlier discovery made by Africa Energy and Total in the same block. Earlier this year, Africa Energy doubled its stake in the consortium exploring the block to 10 percent. Total is the operator. Africa Energy should announce the results of the drilling project by the end of next month. The Luiperd prospect is the largest of five prospects in the offshore block 11B/12B in South African waters that have attracted explorers’ attention. Consortium members estimate the resources of Luiperd alone to be in excess of 500 million barrels.
 What’s more important is that, according to Africa Energy, the Luiperd prospect offers as much as 80 percent of success—""unheard of in frontier exploration today,"" the company’s chief executive Garrett Soden told an industry conference. The entire offshore block has potential reserves of several billion barrels. Drilling in Zimbabwe An Australian company, Invictus, is meanwhile preparing to start drilling exploration wells in Zimbabwe, with the start date scheduled for October 2021. These would be the first oil and gas wells to be drilled in South Africa’s neighbour to the north—another country hopeful it will strike oil, which will boost its energy self-sufficiency.  Related: Natural Gas Prices Explode On Stronger Demand The drilling project is seen to cot some $15 million, Africa Oil and Power reported last week, adding that it builds on promising results from earlier exploration conducted by Exxon. In the 1990s, Exxon identified an area that was highly likely to contain hydrocarbons but dropped the project because it was after oil and the area was more likely to contain gas. The government of the country, which is currently 100-percent dependent on exports for its energy needs, seems fine with gas, too. It is currently putting the finishing touches to a production sharing agreement with Invictus in case oil and gas are found. The Gambian license UK-based explorer PetroNor earlier this month received a 30-year drilling license from the Gambian government after an arbitration process concerning two offshore blocks. After the successful completion of the arbitration, PetroNor will have rights to explore just one of the blocks, with the other passing to an unnamed “major oil company”. The new license is based on a new production-sharing framework developed by the Gambian government, which, according to PetroNor, is more favourable for explorers and producers. The company now has a year to decide if it wants to proceed with drilling in the offshore block.
 Pandemic delays Despite all the positive news from frontier regions in Africa, the continent has not been spared the fallout of the pandemic that destroyed a lot of oil and gas demand. Kenya’s government, for instance, said recently that Covid-19 had slowed down exploration in the Turkana region, which would delay Kenya’s ambitions to become an oil exporter until 2024, from an earlier plan to start shipping oil abroad in 2022. The pandemic has also delayed exploratory drilling in Mozambique following the distribution of new blocks in a government tender. It was supposed to begin this year but “some adjustments” the pandemic necessitated have pushed the schedule to 2021-2022. One of the biggest producers on the continent, meanwhile, is working on a new exploration strategy to boost its oil and gas reserves. Angola’s government earlier this month approved a plan, to take effect by 2025, that would see the country boost its exploration activities to increase recoverable reserves and make sure it produces at least 1 million bpd by 2040. South Africa, on the other hand, has delayed a new oil and gas exploration and production bill that was supposed to be passed this year, again because of the pandemic. Now, the deadline for the approval of the bill has been moved to the end of the third quarter of 2021. Overall, however, the picture appears to be better in Africa’s frontier oil regions than in legacy producing parts of the world.",0.9973,positive
Oil Prices Rise After EIA Reports Crude Inventory Draw.html,"Crude oil prices reversed their decline today after the Energy Information Administration reported an oil inventory draw of 1.6 million barrels for the week to September 18. This compares with a draw of 4.4 million barrels for the previous week. The report came a day after the American Petroleum Institute propped prices up temporarily by estimating a sizeable decline in gasoline stocks, coupled with a modest build in crude oil stocks. Analysts, on the other hand, had expected the EIA this week to report an inventory draw of 2.325 million barrels. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 4 million barrels for the week to September 18, compared with a decline of 400,000 barrels for the previous week. This also helped prices up.
 Gasoline production averaged 9.3 million bpd last week, up on a week earlier, when gasoline output averaged just 8.8 million bpd. In distillate fuels, which are giving refiners a headache as demand for them remains a lot more subdued than demand for gasoline, the EIA reported a draw in stocks of 3.4 million barrels. This compares to a build of 3.5 million barrels estimated for the previous week amid still severely limited air travel. Distillate fuel production last week averaged 4.5 million bpd, compared with 4.4 million bpd a week earlier.
 Oil prices were still down at the time of writing, with Brent crude trading at $41.69 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate trading at $39.70 a barrel. The decline is hardly a surprise: it came amid deepening worry about the future state of oil demand as economic reports from different parts of the world suggested that any recovery would be slow. It also came soon after the news broke that Libya was reopening some of its oil export terminals and boosting production. OilX reported that plans were to raise production to 260,000 bpd, from currently below 100,000 bpd. In a precarious price environment, this production boost was bound to pressure prices despite OPEC+’s stated success with production cuts.",-0.9534,negative
Gazprom Neft Sees Full Oil Demand Recovery By The End Of 2021.html,"Russia’s oil producer Gazprom Neft believes that global oil demand will return to its pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2021, chief executive Alexander Dyukov said at an energy forum in Russia on Wednesday. “Many countries are either expecting or facing a second wave, but we believe that very harsh quarantine measures, like the ones earlier this year especially in Europe, will not be re-imposed,” Dyukov said, as quoted by Russian news agency TASS.   “We hope oil consumption will return to the pre-crisis levels in the second half of next year,” the CEO of Gazprom Neft said. 
 Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak is slightly more optimistic than Dyukov, as Novak said last week that he expects oil demand to recover fully from the effects of the pandemic by the second quarter of 2021. Global inventories of crude oil declined by 45 million barrels in August after a 34-million-barrel reduction in July, Novak said in a TV interview. “Reserves accumulated in the second quarter are gradually shrinking, and we see that July and August were the first two months when stocks declined gradually. The reduction roughly amounted to 45 mln barrels in August and 34 [mln barrels] in July,” Novak told Rossiya-24.
 Novak said that he expected oil demand to recover fully from the effects of the pandemic by the second quarter of 2021. Even now the oil market is in a supply deficit, amounting to between 1.5 and 2 million bpd, which is helping to reduce inventories, the minister said. OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA), however, do not believe global oil demand will fully recover from the effect of the pandemic next year. Last week, the IEA cut its forecast for global oil demand this year, citing an “even more fragile outlook” about the oil market rebalancing and expecting demand to fall by 8.4 million bpd from 2019. OPEC also downgraded its global oil demand forecast for the second time in a row. OPEC now sees oil demand dropping by 9.5 million bpd this year compared to 2019, as risks with the pandemic and economic activity remain skewed to the downside. ",-0.8877,negative
Chinas Oil Buying Spree Is Coming To An End.html,"In a fresh sign that China is slowing down its crude oil buying spree, Beijing appears to have reduced stockpiling for a second consecutive month in August, suggesting that China's record-breaking oil imports and the support they gave to the fragile oil market may be over. According to estimates from Reuters columnist Clyde Russell, based on official data for oil imports plus domestic production, less refinery processing rates, China likely stashed 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in its strategic petroleum reserve or commercial storage in August. In July, China was estimated to have likely sent 1.92 million bpd into its reserves. This was much lower than the estimated reserve fill in June of 2.77 million bpd, but close to the average for the January-July period reserve stockpiling of 1.95 million bpd, Russell estimated last month.
 China imported record volumes of crude oil in May and June, as the oil-hungry nation attempted to benefit from the low oil prices in April. The bargain-hunting for dirt cheap oil resulted in queues at Chinese ports with tankers waiting for weeks to discharge crude that has likely been loaded three to four months ago. Going forward, there is always the big unknown with China’s commercial and strategic reserves. Since China does not report inventories, analysts are only guessing how much crude oil China is stashing away in its strategic and commercial reserves and how full they are. Early tanker-tracking estimates for September suggest that China’s crude oil imports may be significantly lower this month. China’s imports of crude oil have been trending much lower in September than in the past four months, while the rest of Asia is also significantly slowing imports this month with demand still under pressure, IHS Markit said last week.
 “Activity so far in September suggests that the world’s biggest importer of crude oil has been absorbing much less than a month ago,” said Fotios Katsoulas, Liquid Bulk Principal Analyst, Maritime & Trade, at IHS Markit.",-0.9932,negative
Libyas Oil Production Set To Rise To 260000 Bpd Next Week.html,"Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) sees oil production rising to around 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) next week, up from some 100,000 bpd before the blockade of its oil ports and oilfields was lifted at the end of last week. According to an NOC post on Facebook, carried by The Libya Observer, NOC is also proceeding with arranging for oil tankers to start arriving from Wednesday to ship crude from oil ports that are safe and not occupied by armed groups.   Crude shipments will resume from the ports of Brega and Hariga at first and will be later followed by other ports, depending on the safety and security situation, NOC said. Over the weekend, Libya’s state oil corporation lifted the force majeure on the oil terminals it considered safe, and said it would restart production from certain fields and some exports of crude oil. NOC will only restart production at “safe” fields and exports from safe ports, the company said.
 “Our main concern is to start production and exports taking into account the safety of workers and operations, as well as to prevent any attempts to politicize the national oil sector, which means that the NOC is doing its technical and non-political mission to resume operations in the safe areas and a technical evaluation is under way in preparation for the start of production and exports,” NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said.  Related: Oil Prices Slide As Libya Restarts Production The head of the Libyan National Army (LNA), General Khalifa Haftar, whose troops, with help from affiliated groups, blockaded Libya’s oil ports in January, announced the end of the blockade on Friday. The prospect of Libyan oil returning to the oil market struggling with weak demand recovery contributed to the sell-off in oil on Monday. “Obviously, the global oil market is in a fragile state, given the slower than expected demand recovery, therefore any additional supply is only going to make efforts from OPEC+ to rebalance the market more difficult,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said.
 Commenting on Monday’s sell-off in oil, John Hardy, Head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank, said: “Together with the expected reopening of Libya’s oil industry, the market took fright with Brent falling to $41/b, the 61.8% retracement of last week’s rally.” ",0.7579,positive
The Worlds Most Expensive Crudes Get Expensive Again.html,"Despite being only 9 months in, this year has provided us with a rollercoaster of developments on the oil market and upended the market’s usual understanding of where crude differentials ought to be. Yet perhaps some of the newly-emerging trends will stay with us a little longer than one might expect and nowhere is this presupposition more likely than in the light-heavy sweet pricing dynamics in Asia. Freshly into the new world of IMO 2020 requirements, the first months of 2020 have elevated almost all of Asia’s sweet grades amidst the closing of arbitrage flows – at that period freight rates were ballooning into double their usual level. By May 2020, however, heavy sweet differentials have started to reach all-time highs and nowhere was it truer than with Australia’s crude exports. Historically, one would seek for the world’s most expensive crudes in Malaysia. There, grades like Tapis, Kimanis and Kikeh would be generally at least 4-5 USD per barrel above Brent, largely due to their superior refining characteristics. In fact, a little less than 3 years ago I’ve written an article here stating that Tapis was the most expensive crude globally due to its extremely low Sulphur content and the specificities of the Southeast Asian crude market. Today Malaysian differentials have given away the garland of superiority to Australia’s heavy sweet crudes, such as Vincent or Van Gogh – oddly enough, premia as high as +31 USD per barrel to Dated Brent are a direct consequence not of the crudes’ refining value but rather their blending utility. Graph 1. Vincent and NW Shelf Condensate against Dated Brent in 2020 (USD per barrel).  Source: Platts. The shift turned quite tangible with the introduction of IMO 2020; for a market as profitable as the Asian shipping market Australian low-sulphur heavy grades turned out to be an ideal solution. As opposed to regional competitors blending Vincent or Van Gogh into the low sulfur fuel oil pool is rendering the final marine fuel fully compliant with IMO 2020 0.5% Sulphur requirement. Not only did Australian heavy crudes turn out to be uniquely well-placed for the Asian LSFO market, to avail oneself of such crudes it is no longer necessary to carry out a massive blending campaign in Singapore or other hubs, oftentimes the blending would take place onboard the given vessel – the Australian grades would be mixed with the usual marine fuel whose Sulphur content is above 0.5%, to create a blend that is fully IMO 2020 compliant.

 Graph 2. Australian Crude Exports in 2017-2020 (‘000 barrels per day).  Source: Thomson Reuters. Apart from the IMO 2020 requirements, Australian grades also happen to have great flash points, hence minimizing risks that any sudden fuel ignition would cause problems to the vessel’s engine. Additionally, their pour point is also low – in stark contrast to African heavy sweet grades like the Chadian Doba which routinely wield pour point levels well above 0° C (Doba has a pour point of +27° C, the lighter Angolan Cabinda wields +18° C). Van Gogh’s pour point level stands at -15° C, Vincent’s hovers around -17° C whilst Pyrenees’ is at -35° C. When Santos’ sale of an Aframax cargo of Pyrenees this March yielded a +31 USD per barrel premium to Dated Brent (the cargo was reportedly sold to a Japanese firm), all of the above has played out to create the world’s most expensive crude.  Related: China’s Crude Oil Imports Are Slowing Down Some years ago, when Heavy Sulphur marine fuel market was not threatened by the imminent IMO 2020 standards, heavy sweet Australian grades would traditionally go to sophisticated Indian and Chinese refiners that could handle their density, with a small but steady stream of deliveries to the United States. For instance, 5 years ago almost all of the Pyrenees export stream went directly to China – this year, however, all but one cargo was supplied to Singapore (the remaining one went to Saudi Arabia). This Singapore-oriented trend can be seen across all heavy sweet Australian grades and explains to a large extent the high differentials, moreover, in some cases the oil producers have sought to improve the flash points of their crudes to render them even more attractive on the marine fuel market. Graph 3. Share of Vincent Exports Going to Singapore in 2017-2020 (‘000 barrels per day).
  Source: Thomson Reuters. One of the main crude grades to witness the IMO-2020-induced differential appreciation, Vincent, was restarted in 2019 after a year’s maintenance on the field itself, just in time to reap the benefits of being one of the most-coveted crude types in Asia. Woodside Petroleum, the operator of the production license WA-28-L that contains the 73 MMbbls Vincent field, has effectuated a really timely maintenance on the asset in 2018/2019. Vincent went offline for one year starting from May 2018, as Woodside refitted the Ngujima-Yin FPSO so that it can accommodate also three other fields around Vincent. At that time media reports have stated that the one-year maintenance would not have a “massive impact” as the 17° API density crude had limited crude outlets because of its heavy nature. For Australia in general this creates a bit of a head-scratcher, given that it is condensate and light crude production that has been generally on the increase whilst output from fields that yield heavy sweet crudes move in the opposite, declining, direction. Australia’s condensates (as can be seen in Graph 1 with NW Shelf Condensate) have suffered greatly from the plummeting of light distillate refining margins in April and just when it seemed that demand might be picking up again as August witnessed the first month of positive Singapore refining margins, the second coronavirus wave struck. Thus, despite being really suitable feedstock for gasoline blending and petrochemical production, Australia’s condensates trade 9-10 USD per barrel lower than its heavy sweet grades.",0.9646,positive
Low Oil Prices Havent Derailed Brazils Offshore Boom.html,"Activity in Brazil’s energy patch keeps ratcheting ever higher. During January 2020, Latin America’s largest economy saw its all-important petroleum industry achieve a new milestone pumping on average a record 3.168 million barrels of crude daily. The COVID-19 pandemic and March 2020 oil price collapse did little to slow the oil boom underway in Latin America’s largest economy. Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras, in March 2020, slashed planned annual spending by 29% and shuttered its shallow water platforms in response to the pandemic and oil price collapse. This did little to stymie production growth. Petrobras’s second quarter 2020 commercial oil output grew 4.1% year over year to almost 2.5 million barrels daily. That was driven primarily by the significant expansion of the national oil company’s presence in the pre-salt fields, where production expanded almost 31% to 1.5 million barrels daily. There are signs that even the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, softer oil demand and weaker prices will not deter Petrobras’ growing petroleum production. Petrobras is in the process of ramping up activities at its offshore operations, notably in the prolific pre-salt fields, as the threat of the pandemic declines. Brazil’s national oil company plans to recommence connecting new wells, conducting maintenance and commissioning new operations this month. That will give both the national oil company’s and Brazil’s hydrocarbon output a solid lift.  The measures taken to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending non-essential operations, as well as the shuttering of non-economic oil production because of the price crash, have had little impact on Brazil’s hydrocarbon output. Data from the National Petroleum Agency (ANP – Portuguese acronym) shows Brazil’s August 2020 oil and natural gas production averaged just over 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent daily, almost 1% greater than July and 2.6% higher than the same period a year earlier.   Source: Brazil National Petroleum Agency (ANP) & U.S. EIA. It is the Santos and Campos Basins which are responsible for producing most of Brazil’s petroleum and natural gas, pumping 68% and almost 26% respectively of July’s hydrocarbon output. Petrobras is the key producer, pumping almost 95% of Brazil’s total August oil output.
  Related: China’s Crude Oil Imports Are Slowing Down Brazil’s August 2020 production, according to industry consultancy IHS Markit, remained strong as indicated by export volumes, only declining marginally compared to a month earlier. In fact, petroleum exports have grown significantly since the start of 2020, with China now a key market for Brazilian oil. The March 2020 oil price collapse saw Chinese oil imports expand, despite waning demand, as Beijing seized the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices to fill strategic oil reserves. That has been an important driver of activity in Brazil’s offshore oil fields.  The importance of oil exports to the world’s most populated country for Brazil’s economy and its oil industry cannot be emphasized enough. By the end of July 2020, China accounted for a notable 70% of Brazil’s oil exports.  That will keep growing despite the economic fallout from the pandemic and sharply weaker oil prices. Recent data, however, indicates that Brazil’s August 2020 oil cargoes destined for China fell by 5% compared to May and June. That is attributed by consultancy IHS Markit to severe congestion at several ports in China. The August decline in oil exports to China, which appeared to worsen during early-September, was offset by increased shipments to South East Asia and India, which have been steadily rising. It is anticipated that Brazil’s oil production will keep expanding at a solid clip as major offshore projects are developed and come on-line. The International Energy Agency believes that the Latin American country will deliver one of the largest increases in global petroleum supply from countries outside of the OPEC cartel by 2025. If Brazil’s rig count is used as an indicator of industry activity it is possible to see that the tempo of operations is rising. By the end of August 2020, Baker Hughes data shows there were 10 operational rigs, two greater than July and one higher than for the same month in 2020. The volume of operational rigs is trending higher after reaching its lowest number for the last year in July. Related: Oil Bulls Return As OPEC+ Reassures Markets
  Source: Baker Hughes & U.S. EIA. The attractiveness of Brazil’s prolific pre-salt oil fields is easy to understand. They produce a light, low sulfur crude which is particularly desirable for Asian refiners as the push to reduce maritime carbon emissions grows. Pre-salt fields also have low breakeven prices which are pegged at $35 to $45 per barrel, while Petrobras claims it is breaking even at $21 a barrel for the crude it pumps. That makes Brazil’s deep-water pre-salt fields especially attractive in the current environment where sharply softer oil prices, which sees the international Brent benchmark trading at around $43 per barrel, weighs on investment and activity. Nonetheless, before the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil’s economically crucial hydrocarbon sector was facing headwinds. Global energy majors snubbed two of Brazil’s 2019 oil auctions because of a renewed focus on profitability and the preferential rights of the national oil company. There is also considerable downside risk to exploration and development activity because of significantly lower oil prices. Petrobras, like many other global energy majors, had based projected capital expenditures for 2020 to 2024 on $50 a barrel, or higher, Brent. As a result, Brazil’s national oil company sharply reduced 2020 spending and shuttered uneconomic production, negatively affecting the Latin American country’s petroleum output. In a recent statement, Petrobras said as a result 2021 to 2025 capital spending would total $40 billion compared to an initial estimate of $64 billion for 2020 to 2024. The ongoing oil price slump means that global energy majors will keep the brakes on investment in exploration and new projects for the foreseeable future. However, with the international benchmark still hovering at around $40 per barrel, oil companies including Petrobras will continue to keep capital spending low as they focus on protecting balance sheets and preserving capital. That will continue to impact exploration activities and the development of new projects. Offshore, Brazil’s low breakeven prices, however, makes it an attractive proposition for international energy majors seeking to build oil reserves and production.",0.7105,positive
Gulf Of Mexico Oil Drillers Evacuate As Another Storm Approaches.html,"Oil producers in the western Gulf of Mexico are bracing for yet another storm this week as Tropical Storm Beta is moving toward west and northwest, threatening storm conditions along the south Texas coast later on Monday. As early as on Saturday, Royal Dutch Shell said it had evacuated all personnel from the Perdido platform in the western Gulf of Mexico and had shut in production, as a precautionary measure ahead of Tropical Storm Beta, while all rigs in the area “are monitoring the weather and are securing operations.” The National Hurricane Center warned in an advisory early on Monday that it had issued a Storm Surge Warning—meaning that there is a danger of life-threatening flooding, from rising water moving inland from the coastline during the next 36 hours.

 In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, oil operators had just started to return personnel to the platforms they had evacuated last week when Sally hit the area before making landfall in Louisiana. As of Sunday, September 20, personnel have been evacuated from a total of 23 production platforms, or 3.58 percent of the 643 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), which continued to monitor offshore oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico as companies resume operations on platforms and rigs following Hurricane Sally. As of Sunday, 179,237 bpd of oil production, or 9.69 percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, was shut in, BSEE said.",-0.4404,negative
Oil Prices Slide As Libya Restarts Production.html,"Libya’s National Oil Corporation will restart production from certain fields and some exports of crude oil, the company said, as quoted by local media, adding that it will only restart production at “safe” fields and exports from safe ports. “Our main concern is to start production and exports taking into account the safety of workers and operations, as well as to prevent any attempts to politicize the national oil sector, which means that the NOC is doing its technical and non-political mission to resume operations in the safe areas and a technical evaluation is under way in preparation for the start of production and exports,” NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said. The force majeure will be lifted from fields and ports that are free of the presence of paramilitary groups and mercenaries, but remain in effect for those where there are still such groups, which hamper the work of NOC, the company said.
 The head of the Libyan National Army General Khalifa Haftar, whose troops, with help from affiliated groups, blockaded Libya’s oil ports in January, announced the end of the blockade on Friday. On the same day, NOC’s Sanalla said the force majeure will be lifted from the facilities only after they are demilitarized. Currently, oil production in Libya is just 100,000 bpd—down from 1.2 million bpd at the start of the year, just before the blockade in January. In recent weeks, rival factions and the foreign powers supporting them have been negotiating some kind of an agreement that could lead to Libyan oil returning to the global market at a time of weak demand recovery and weak oil prices. The latest news is likely to arrest or even reverse an improvement in oil prices that followed OPEC+’s latest meeting that offered a glimmer of hope for supply, if not demand.
 But now that Libya will start bringing production back on, things may well change as the OPEC+ agreement relied on the country’s involuntary contribution to the overall supply curbs.",0.9693,positive

Investors Are Pulling The Plug On Argentinas Prized Shale Play.html,"Much ink has been spilled about the downfall and dubious recovery of the United States shale oil sector. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude benchmark’s dramatic rock bottom in April, which saw oil prices plunge to nearly $40 dollars below zero in a jaw-dropping first, a flurry of think pieces about the sector’s future poured forth and has never fully stopped. While the Brent international crude benchmark never went negative, it also suffered, and there have been no shortage of headlines about OPEC and their ill-planned actions that sent prices tumbling in the first place or their redoubled efforts to recover after the crash. But there are plenty of other oil producing countries in the world who have also seen massive market failures due to COVID-19’s destruction of oil demand and which have not received even a fraction of the attention. One such country is Argentina, home to one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world, the Vaca Muerta shale basin, which contains approximately 927 million barrels of proven reserves.  Way back in April, even before the historic WTI crash, Bloomberg (via World Oil) published one of relatively few reports of the shale play. More than a report, it was an obituary. “Oil crash kills Vaca Muerta’s potential as the next shale hotspot,” the headline read.  The April 2 article read: “Just a bit more than 3 weeks ago, the head of Argentina’s state-run driller outlined an aggressive $1.8 billion spending plan for 2020 in the country’s Vaca Muerta shale region, based on $60-a-barrel crude. With global prices starting the year above $68, it wasn’t unrealistic. Now, all bets are off.” Now, nearly half a year later, is Vaca Muerta fully dead? The short answer is no. The full answer, of course, is a lot more complicated. According to the Argentinian energy minister of Neuquen province, where the vast Vaca Muerta field is located, resurrecting the shale play will take more than a year. Achieving pre-COVID-19 production levels, he said, will take an estimated 12-18 months due to a lack of market demand, which may not be bouncing back any time soon. “We believe it will take a while for fuel demand to fully recover,” Monteiro told listeners on Monday in an industry webinar.
 Before COCID-19, Vaca Muerta had been in a state of rapid expansion, as Bloomberg's “next potential shale hotspot” description would indicate. The novel coronavirus, however, stopped this expansion in its tracks, leaving many projects half-completed. “Many wells have been drilled but not connected, but even when demand fully recovers it will take even longer for drilling activity to return to pre-pandemic levels because of storage constraints,” MercoPress reported this week, summing up the energy minister’s announcement. This is exemplified by YPF, Argentina’s largest shale producer, which is controlled by the state. YPF “has said it has 71 shale oil wells and 10 shale gas wells in Neuquen that have been drilled but not completed.”  In recent years investors have poured huge sums of money into developing the “next potential shale hotspot” in what seemed like a sure bet at the time. But hindsight is always 20-20. “In mid-2019, companies had said they would invest a total of more than US$ 6bn in upstream projects in Neuquen in 2020,” MercoPress reports. “Now the number is closer to US$ 3bn, the lowest since 2016, according to provincial data.”   Related: Oil Prices Regain Lost Ground As Stock Markets Recover The drop in investment was not only fueled by market forces due to the pandemic, but actually started well before the world had heard of the novel coronavirus. “Companies put the brakes on investment following a fuel and crude price freeze implemented in August 2019 by the administration of then-president Mauricio Macri shortly before he lost reelection to Alberto Fernandez,” MercoPress explains. “The price freeze, coupled with policy uncertainty under the new government and weaker market conditions this year, eroded Argentina's climate for upstream investment.”
 While Neuquen did register an increase in oil production in July, the numbers pale in comparison to what they could have been in a business-as-usual scenario. “Vaca Muerta registered just 44 fractures in July, compared with 398 a year earlier,”  US-based services firm NCS Multistage told MercoPress.  The Argentinian government does have strategies in place to revive the domestic shale industry and get Vaca Muerta’s development back on track, including a new gas subsidy plan, but Monteiro says that more and stronger policy measures, including tax incentives and lowered crude export taxes, will be necessary to bring the nation’s shale sector back to pre-COVID levels of activity.  Taking a step back, however, putting more investment dollars and more taxpayer funding into the shale sector may be a shortsighted endeavor. The world, of course, will not wean itself off of oil overnight, but a worldwide energy transition is already underway. Many experts contend that the most potential for economic growth and post-pandemic economic recovery does not lie in trying to reinstitute pre-COVID economic strategies, but instead requires planning for a future in which fossil fuels no longer pay. Already we’ve seen that, in Europe at least, Big Oil’s Most Profitable Business Is No Longer Oil, and that oil exploration in general may no longer be profitable. If Argentina is able to get Vaca Muerta back on track in 12-18 months, that will certainly be a boon to the country’s economy, there’s no doubt about it--but for how long?",-0.9579,negative
Chinas Crude Oil Imports Are Slowing Down.html,"China’s imports of crude oil have been trending much lower in September than in the past four months, while the rest of Asia is also significantly slowing imports this month with demand still under pressure, IHS Markit said on Friday.   Crude oil discharged at Chinese ports in the last two weeks were below 8 million barrels per day (bpd), at levels similar to what China imported in March and April, Fotios Katsoulas, Liquid Bulk Principal Analyst, Maritime & Trade, at IHS Markit, said in an analysis. So far in the third quarter, China’s crude oil imports have stayed strong, with high congestion at many major crude ports.
 “But activity so far in September suggests that the world’s biggest importer of crude oil has been absorbing much less than a month ago,” Katsoulas said. Earlier this year, China imported record volumes of crude oil in May and June, as the oil-hungry nation attempted to benefit from the low oil prices in April. The record-breaking crude oil imports supported oil prices through the late spring and summer when oil demand recovery in the rest of the world had just started and then wobbled amid concerns of a second COVID-19 wave. Yet, China’s feast on low oil prices may now be over. In August, China was expected to have imported what could be the last of the bargain cargoes that refiners had snapped up in April.
 Refiners in China are now “facing difficulties in absorbing these barrels and find buyers for refined products locally produced. This translates into significantly fewer fresh deals for crude oil, with shipments to China continuing to decline,” IHS Markit’s Katsoulas noted. The rest of Asia is also importing much less crude oil than in the previous months, with South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan particularly weak compared to earlier this year, according to data from IHS Markit Commodities at Sea. “Overall, oil imports to Asia have extended losses and could report the lowest figure this year, with volumes down between eight and 10% so far this month since August,” Katsoulas said, noting that India’s very slow demand recovery is also weighing on Asia’s crude oil imports and on oil prices.

Russian Oil Minister Global Oil Inventories Are In Decline.html,"Global inventories of crude oil declined by 45 million barrels in August after a 34-million-barrel reduction in July, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a TV interview. ""Reserves accumulated in the second quarter are gradually shrinking, and we see that July and August were the first two months when stocks declined gradually. The reduction roughly amounted to 45 mln barrels in August and 34 [mln barrels] in July,"" Novak told Rossiya-24. In more good news, Novak said that he expected oil demand to recover fully from the effects of the pandemic by the second quarter of 2021. Even now the oil market is in a supply deficit, amounting to between 1.5 and 2 million bpd, which is helping to reduce inventories, the official said.
 While Russia’s top oil man appears to be optimistic about the future of the oil market, his Saudi counterpart has taken a different stance, sending a stark warning to speculators who might want to make a profit on that market. “Anyone who thinks they will get a word from me on what we will do next, is absolutely living in a La La Land... I’m going to make sure whoever gambles on this market will be ouching like hell,” Abdulaziz bin Salma told reporters at yesterday’s OPEC+ meeting, as quoted by Reuters. To short-sellers in particular, Prince Abdulaziz, who is the brother of Crown Prince Mohammed, had a message from Dirty Harry: “Make my day.” 
 Before that, Abdulaziz lashed out at OPEC laggards, warning them full compliance with the production cuts was “not a charity”. OPEC+ ministers met yesterday to discuss the progress of their production cut agreement and next steps. As in previous meetings, the ministerial committee insisted on better compliance, even though the rate for August reached 101 percent. The cut target remained unchanged at 7.7 million bpd. If Russia’s Novak is right, that should be enough to see a return to balance on oil markets as demand recovers. Not all, however, agree it will, now or ever.",0.6466,positive
Oversupply Adds To Grim Oil Demand Outlook.html,,0.0,neutral
Lower Oil Production Hits Pipeline Operators Hard.html,"Just two years ago, U.S. pipeline operators were rushing to build pipelines in Texas to move surging Permian oil and gas production to the refining and export centers on the Gulf Coast.    This year’s crash in oil demand and prices led to a U.S. shale production decline as many operators in all major shale plays curtailed output to sit out the sub $40 oil prices at which they don’t make money. The shale production crash spilled over to the midstream sector, which was caught between falling oil production and pipeline utilization from the upstream and crumbling demand for fuels in the downstream. Something had to give in the U.S. midstream sector. And it did. Pipeline infrastructure companies started to announce deferrals of final investment decisions and start-up dates for planned oil and gas pipelines, especially in the Permian, which suddenly found itself with a overbuild of capacity as production and consumption of oil struggled to recover from the pandemic-driven crisis. On top of the growing pile of canceled pipeline projects, the U.S. midstream is ripe for consolidation with increased competition and weakened financial profiles of some operators, analysts and industry executives say. The U.S. energy infrastructure sector also faces contractual risks as bankruptcies in the upstream increase, as well as regulatory risks with delayed pipeline approvals and the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Pipelines Not Immune To Price Crash   The distress in the exploration and production (E&P) sector spread to the midstream, Alex Beeker, Principal Analyst, Corporate Research at Wood Mackenzie, said in June. “For midstream companies that made huge investments based on pre-Covid-19 production forecasts, low utilisation now presents a challenge. Midstream infrastructure projects, many of which were financed with high levels of debt, will struggle to deliver projected returns. And cash flow is falling in tandem with utilisation, limiting the ability of the midstream to increase distribution,” said Beeker. The recovery will not be speedy, according to oil and gas data analytics company Enverus. The upstream slashing capex and companies going bust at these low oil prices raises the contract and throughput volume risks for the pipeline operators, Enverus said in a report on the U.S. midstream last month.
 “It’s been a tough year for the industry and a rebalance will be anything but quick,” Bernadette Johnson, vice president of Strategic Analytics at Enverus, said. “Somewhat caught in the middle between struggling E&P companies and the historical drop in demand from consumers, due to COVID-19, the midstream sector in particular is also vulnerable to regulatory threats, legal rulings and a challenging pipeline permit approval process,” Johnson added. Pipeline Projects Canceled  To weather the current crisis, the midstream sector is also slashing capital expenditures to protect weakened balance sheets. This has led to deferrals or outright cancelation of pipeline projects.  The latest announcement of a canceled oil pipeline came from Enterprise Products Partners, which said that it was scrapping the 450,000 barrels per day Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline project. The cancellation of the project is set to save the company around US$800 million in aggregate growth capital expenditures for the period 2020-2022.  Related: China Not Looking To Ban Gasoline Powered Cars Any Time Soon “The capital savings from the cancellation of M2E4 will accelerate Enterprise toward being discretionary free cash flow positive, which would give us the flexibility to reduce debt and return additional capital to our partners, including through buybacks,” A. J. Teague, co-CEO of Enterprise’s general partner, said. As of April, Enterprise Products Partners had canceled or deferred spending on 13 projects, deferring Midland-to-ECHO 4, but Teague insisted back then that the project was “not cancellable” as it was underpinned by long-term contracts. 
 But within five months, Enterprise Products did cancel the project, preferring to save capex and cut debt instead of waiting for the demand recovery, which now everyone knows will not be V-shaped. Consolidation Is On The Horizon In this period of lower shale production and lower demand from consumers, pipeline operators will be moving toward optimization instead of growing volumes and adding overcapacity in pipeline infrastructure, executives say. According to the chief executive of Plains All American Pipeline LP, Willie Chiang, consolidation is coming in the midstream sector. “We’re at the point now where I think we are shifting out of growth and going toward optimization,” Chiang said at the Barclays CEO Energy - Power Conference last week, as carried by Houston Business Journal. “I do think as we go forward, more consolidation will happen,” Chiang said, adding that acquisitions were not a top priority for Plains All American Pipeline. Still, a strategic joint venture is a priority when the company looks at opportunities ahead, he noted. In the first half of 2020, the midstream segment accounted for 38 percent of the volume and 66 percent of the value of oil and gas deals, according to PwC’s report ‘Oil and gas deals insights: Midyear 2020.’ But two of the large midstream deals were essentially changes in the corporate structure and were both announced before the pandemic. Going forward, PwC forecasts that “Increasing project costs as a result of lengthy litigation processes, and the regulatory uncertainty pending the US Presidential Election could lead to divestitures in the segment.” “We expect private equity and infrastructure investment funds to be active in the second half of the year,” PwC said. ",-0.4228,negative
A Wave Of Consolidations Hit Canadas Oil Patch.html,"A vicious one-two-three punch that started with a gloomy long-term future outlook due to rampant fossil fuel divestments, climate change policies, and decarbonization as well as shorter-term—but severe—shocks from the COVID-19 crisis, has thrown Canada’s most important export industry into an existential crisis.  Meanwhile, the drumbeat of exits by foreign oil firms bailing on the unprofitable tar sands has added an extra layer of gloom for an industry responsible for a fifth of Canada’s exports. It, therefore, comes as little surprise that Canada’s oil and gas producers are scrambling to merge as they hope to survive to see another oil boom. A wave of consolidation has hit Canada’s Montney oil and gas region as smaller companies sell their assets to bigger oil firms. Straddling northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta, the Montney is one of Canada’s leading shale oil epicenters, producing 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 45% of Western Canada’s gas supply. Prolonged downturn Faced with a six-year oil downturn, smaller, debt-ridden oil and gas producers are giving up the wait for rebound and resorting to mergers in a bid to survive. 
 They have little recourse: Just like their shale counterparts further south, Canada’s oil industry has seen once-prolific credit lines dry up as the value of their reserves rapidly dwindle during the prolonged crisis. Eighteen Canadian companies tracked by Wood Mackenzie saw the amount of their reserve-based loans shrivel by some C$1.8 billion, or 22% in the year-to-date. Consequently, the Montney region has recorded at least nine significant deals worth some C$2.3 billion ($1.75 billion) over the past 12 months.  Related: The Secret To Survival For Canada’s Oil Sands Two of the largest deals were acquisition of acreage by U.S. major ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) from Kelt Exploration (TSE:KEL) for $325 million as well as Canadian Natural Resources Limited’s (NYSE:CNQ) purchase of Painted Pony Energy in a $461 million deal. It’s worth noting that CNQ assumed Painted Pony’s total debt of approximately $350 million upon the purchase. Companies operating in Canada’s natural gas sector have not been faring much better amidst the historic price crash. One of the Montney’s earliest gas drillers, Advantage Oil and Gas (TSE:AAV), sold a stake in its Glacier gas plant in July for C$100 million ($75.7M) in a bid to raise cash for operations but says it remains open to a complete merger. Unfortunately, companies such as AAV could struggle to find buyers, given that there are very few potential buyers with strong enough balance sheets and easy access to capital to make deals. U.S. shale companies—some of the top prospective buyers—have also been struggling with the same issue. Private equity bargain hunting
 Dozens of companies in the Canadian Oil Patch, such as Bow Energy Ltd. (CVE:ONG) and Cequence Energy Ltd (TSX:CQE), have filed for bankruptcy protection or opted to restructure. Others like Obsidian Energy Ltd. (OTCMKTS: OBELF), however, are going off the beaten path--putting themselves up for purchase by private equity (PE) firms. PE firms like Waterous Energy Fund have turned into trophy hunters, buying up distressed assets at dirt-cheap valuations. A good case in point is last year’s purchase of Pengrowth Energy Corp. for $740-million by Waterous’ subsidiary Cona Resources, representing less than a fifth of its more than $4B valuation at the time of the deal. Massive discounts have pretty much become par for the course in Canada’s M&A space: A total of 23 such deals have been consummated in the year-to-date for an underwhelming total of  $1.65 billion compared to $15.47 billion deal value from 42 M&A deals completed during last year’s corresponding period.  Related: Iraq Ships More Crude Oil Despite OPEC Output Cut Pledge Waterous is a master of the game, having amalgamated six small producers from different deals into a giant it has dubbed Strathcona Resources Ltd., easily one of North America’s largest private-equity owned drillers with a daily production clip exceeding 60,000 barrels. According to Waterous CEO Adam Waterous, there has never been a greater need for consolidation in Canada’s energy sector, noting that small oil and gas companies have been locked out of debt and equity markets, effectively leaving them orphaned. Waterous says these orphaned businesses need to come together if they are to survive the onslaught, which he does not see ending any time soon. That said, it is worth noting that bigger oil companies have been holding up pretty well, with the likes of Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU), Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE), Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (NYSE:CNQ) and Husky Energy Inc. (TSE:HSE) having little trouble tapping debt markets.",0.9933,positive
US Keeps Top Crude Oil Producer Status.html,"Despite oil production curtailments earlier this year that are not fully back online, the United States maintained its global status as the leading supplier of crude oil in July, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.   According to data from the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) database, which collects self-reported figures from 114 countries, U.S. crude oil production rose in July back up to above 11 million barrels per day (bpd). At 11.035 million bpd, American crude oil output was 5.7 percent higher than the June production of 10.436 million bpd. Production in June had also increased month over month after the May figure of 10 million bpd—the lowest U.S. monthly production since late 2017.   U.S. exports of crude oil also rose in July compared to June. The United States exported 2.867 million bpd in July, up from 2.753 million bpd in June, according to the JODI database.
 The U.S. became the world’s biggest crude oil producer, surpassing both Saudi Arabia and Russia, in 2018, and has kept that status since then, while Saudi Arabia and Russia – bound by their OPEC+ production cut pact to prop up prices and rebalance demand and supply – have been withholding production from the market. The most recent OPEC+ agreement, which started in May after a brief price war between the two rivals-partners in March and April, currently has Russia and Saudi Arabia cut their production and keep it at 9 million bpd each until the end of this year. In June, Russia produced more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, beating it to the second place of the largest oil producers in the world, behind the number-one producer, the United States. June was the month in which Saudi Arabia voluntarily slashed its oil production by an additional 1 million bpd for just one month, on top of the 2.5 million bpd it was supposed to cut as per the OPEC+ deal.

OPEC Warns That Second Wave Of COVID Will Derail Demand Recovery.html,"A resurgence in Covid-19 cases in some countries could further dampen oil demand and interfere with a decline in oil inventories, Reuters has reported, citing an internal document of the OPEC+ technical panel. Cases have been rising in many European countries, total infections in India have passed 5 million, and new cases are on the rise in some U.S. states. Meanwhile, OPEC itself, as well as the International Energy Agency, earlier this week revised their oil demand outlook for the year. Both are now expecting a bigger contraction than they anticipated a month ago.
 The IEA now expects 2020 oil demand to be 8.4 million bpd lower than it was a year ago, and OPEC sees it contracting by 9.5 million bpd. That’s up from 8.1 million bpd and 9.1 million bpd, respectively, that was forecast just a month ago. At the same time, according to the document, global oil inventories are falling. Commodity trading giant Vitol recently chimed in with this opinion, seeing a strong reduction in oil inventories in the next three months, between 250 and 300 million barrels. Not everyone in the industry agrees, however, with Trafigura, who noted a “supply-heavy market” through the end of the year. Meanwhile, OPEC+ has dramatically improved its compliance with the production cuts agreed in April to restore balance on the oil market. In August, sources from the cartel told Reuters, compliance hit 101 percent. The improvement followed Saudi Arabia’s threat to laggards, which include Iraq and Nigeria, with a reversal of its own cuts if they failed to fall in line and compensate for their overproduction in May and June.
 Later today, OPEC+ ministers are meeting to discuss compliance levels and oil’s fundamentals amid yet another negative trend in oil prices, driven by the growing worry about demand. Iraq could complicate matters, with recent reports suggesting OPEC’s number-two may have plans to increase production the first chance it gets to boost vital oil revenues.",0.6808,positive
What BP Got Wrong About Global Oil Demand.html,"Environmentalists around the world are having a field day this week as international media picks up on the oil market forecasts in the recently released BP Energy Outlook 2020. It appears the old theory of Peak Oil is back in the spotlight, with BP indicating that oil demand may never return to 2019 levels. Just as BP’s report was being digested, OPEC released a report cutting its global oil demand forecast by 400,000 bpd for 2020, predicting an average demand drop of 9.5 million bpd compared to its previous estimate of 9.1 million bpd. It predicted demand to grow by 6.6 million bpd in 2021, which was also 400,000 bpd lower than its previous estimate. The oil cartel blames COVID-19 related economic issues for the downward revision. While OPEC’s report did impact oil prices, it was the BP Energy Outlook 2020 that made bigger waves. Both suggest that the U.S. will face significant constraints in bringing oil demand back online but are slightly more optimistic about European and Chinese Demand. OECD oil demand is expected to slowly recover, but demand from the aviation industry is unlikely to bounce back anytime soon. Its most recent report is not the first time that British oil major BP has made news in recent months with its push for a greener future. But its energy outlook assessment is probably the most shocking yet. The report indicated that if governments grow more aggressive in their attempts at reducing carbon emissions, demand may never recover from its current slump. It also stated that oil demand is likely to dramatically fall in the next 30 years, mainly due to the growth of renewable energy. While the picture the report paints of the oil industry in terminal decline has grabbed headlines, there are several reasons that its projections should be viewed with skepticism.
 The first reason is that, at present, the demand destruction we are witnessing has been driven by COVID-19, a Black Swan event that will – at some point – subside. In the meantime, many seem to forget that the demand picture was gloomy even before COVID came along, with too much oil on the markets and in storage. Eventually, IOCs and OPEC will have to act to counter this oversupply, and when they do, demand will react positively. Related: China Not Looking To Ban Gasoline Powered Cars Any Time Soon The second reason to be skeptical of this report is an economic one. Demand for energy and electricity is growing, not in OECD countries but outside, mainly in India, China, MENA, and Africa. These fundamentals are unavoidable. The economic and trade disruptions caused by COVID could even boost oil and gas demand, as a possible redistribution of regional production centers from the current China focus could increase the energy demand for transportation. Thirdly, the media and analysts need to start dividing their oil and gas assessments between the two main blocks, IOCs (Shell, Chevron, BP, Exxon, ENI, and Total) and NOCs (Aramco, ADNOC, Gazprom, etc.). The future of IOCs could be as BP paints it, because financial markets and investors are becoming increasingly conscious of the environment. There is a chance that IOCs face peak oil (and gas) production if activist shareholders and media/government pressure force them to become green. Lower investments combined with lower revenues, margins, and dividends, will be the major threat. NOCs and possibly independents such as Petrofac, however, could be looking at a bright and prosperous future. Even if the demand for oil and gas someday does peak, the call on NOC oil will increase. Lower production of IOCs will be shifting demand to NOCs and new incumbents.
 Still, if there is, as indicated by BP and media analysts, the threat of a peak oil demand scenario in the coming years, it is the IOCs that will bleed. The lack of proactive strategies and the overestimation of their own power has become clear, even if it has yet to be recognized by London, The Hague, and some other places. The integrated oils of the past will be removed or substituted by the New Seven Brothers of the Future. Their margins and financial powers are different, making Peak Oil scenarios unlikely in the next 10-15 years.",-0.9129,negative
BP Bombshell Indias Oil Demand May Peak In 2025.html,"The world’s third-largest oil importer, India, will be the biggest source of energy demand growth through 2050 in any scenario about government policies about the energy transition. However, India may not be as key a driver of global oil demand growth as previously thought. This was one of the messages in the BP Energy Outlook 2020, in which the supermajor said that global oil demand may have already peaked last year as oil consumption may never recover to the pre-pandemic levels.   India’s oil consumption may peak as soon as 2025 at round 6 million barrels per day (bpd), compared to 5.1 million bpd demand in 2018, according to two out of three scenarios BP has examined in its outlook—Rapid and Net Zero.   In the third scenario, Business As Usual (BAU), BP assumes that government policies, technologies, and societal ‎preferences will continue to evolve in a manner and speed seen in the recent past. Under this scenario, India’s oil demand growth still has a long way to run, with oil consumption reaching 9.7 million bpd in 2050. In the Net Zero scenario, Indian oil demand slumps to just 2.4 million bpd in 2050, while the Rapid scenario – assuming a significant increase in carbon prices around the world – India’s oil demand in 2050 will be broadly flat compared to 2018, at 5.2 million bpd, BP estimates.
 It is very likely that future oil demand, in India and globally, is some sort of a combination of the three scenarios BP has laid out. But it is also very likely that oil demand growth, in India and around the world, is going through a seismic shift amid the energy transition and government policies to support the economic recovery from the pandemic-driven recession.    Related: Oil Rises After EIA Confirms Crude Inventory Draw India’s primary energy consumption is set to more than double by 2050 in all three scenarios, but the only fossil fuel growing in all scenarios is natural gas, underpinned by growing population and prosperity, BP said. In addition, renewable energy is set to grow strongly in all the scenarios, becoming the largest energy source in 2050. All in all, the strong growth in primary energy consumption in India will be primarily led by renewable energy and, to a lesser extent, natural gas, BP said.   Globally, we may have passed peak oil demand last year, as fuel consumption may never recover from the pandemic-inflicted decline, BP said.  
 In all of BP’s scenarios, global oil demand is set to decline within 2050. The Rapid and Net Zero scenarios assume that oil demand has already peaked, while in the BAU scenario, demand is expected to peak in the early 2020s, due to growing electrification and efficiency in road transportation. The rise of EVs will see oil demand for transport peaking in the mid- to late-2020s, according to BP’s estimates. As BP said, these three scenarios “are not predictions but, based on alternative assumptions about policies and societal ‎preferences, are designed to help explore the range of outcomes possible over the next 30 ‎years.” The future of the energy mix in India and the world over the next three decades will be some kind of a mix of those assumptions and will depend on government policies, consumer preferences, and the cost competition between renewable energy sources and fossil fuels. Whatever reality turns out to be, the energy outlook of BP – which aims to reinvent itself into an integrated energy company from an international oil company – is a stark warning to Big Oil, OPEC, and oil bulls that oil demand growth may be a thing of the past.",0.9933,positive
Oil Tanker Industry Is In An Ocean Of Trouble.html,"There has been more than enough written about the woes of various segments of the oil industry and related industries so far this year. But there is one industry that actually thrived during the worst of the crisis: as the world drowned in oil amid slumping demand and excess supply, tanker owners enjoyed a bounce in freight rates as these vessels remained the only storage space for unsellable crude. But things have changed. OPEC+ oil production cuts helped bring down global inventories, including the massive amounts of oil in floating storage. This brought down freight rates from over $250,000 per day for a Very Large Crude Carrier to less than $30,000 per day, leaving tanker owners wondering how much longer they could survive. Right now, they have one hope, just like air travel: a successful vaccine. Oil demand is out the window thanks to the pandemic and there is no telling when—and even if—it will ever be coming back. Yet it is pretty easy to link a rebound in economic activity across the world with a rebound in oil demand. This rebound, however, is contingent on mass vaccinations.
 “The list of industries that have been hit hard by Covid-19 is long, with shipping being just one of the many casualties,” shipbroker Gibson said, as quoted by Hellenic Shipping News, earlier this week. “Although in spring tanker rates surged to unprecedented highs amid discharging delays and floating storage demand, today’s market is very different, with TCE earnings on many trades stuck at or below OPEX for a few months now.”  Related: OPEC+ Complied 101% With Oil Production Cuts In August Interestingly enough, demand for tankers for storing oil offshore is on the rise. In fact, Lloyd’s says demand for tankers for floating storage could be the single driver of demand for this industry in the next quarter. Unfortunately, this does not mean that freight rates would recover to the highs of the first half. On Monday, spot rates for Very Large Crude Carriers stood at $27,900 per day, American Shipper senior editor Greg Miller wrote. That’s a lot lower than the $68,000 in average freight rates for the first half of the year and yet it is a massive, 124-percent, improvement on Monday last week. Demand for floating storage is helping tanker owners reach breakeven. But it may take a while to get any better than this. Traders and producers stored as much as 1.3 billion barrels of crude during the first five months of this year, both offshore and onshore, Energy Intelligence’s John van Schaik reported earlier this month. Those were good times for tankers. But then OPEC+ started cutting production and floating—and onshore—storage began draining, at a rate of 100 million barrels monthly. Recovery in oil demand following easing of lockdowns helped, however weak it was. But it hasn’t been enough.
 Even OPEC+’s easing of their production cuts did not help. Bloomberg wrote in July, the month before cuts were reduced by 2 million barrels daily, that the addition of 2 million bpd to world markets would have been good news any other year if it wasn’t preceded by production cuts of 9.7 million bpd for three months before that. Demand for vessels for floating storage was also on the decline at the time, removing this source demand for tankers as well. And to add insult to injury, Russia and Saudi Arabia, the biggest producers in OPEC+, were keeping more of the additional oil they were producing for the domestic market, probably not least because of still unfavourable prices.  Related: Oil Rises After EIA Confirms Crude Inventory Draw As if this was not enough bad news, there is more. Although growing demand for VLCCs for floating storage is on the rise, much of the oil that traders and producers stored in the spring is still there, FreightWaves’ Miller noted. Off the coast of China, according to Kpler data, there are some 67 million barrels in storage alone. This means that the new demand for offshore storage will by necessity be limited, setting a ceiling on freight rates, too. Brent crude is trading at just a little over $40 a barrel after last week it fell below this threshold on renewed concern about future demand. WTI is trading below $39 a barrel. There are more than 170 vaccine candidates in different stages of development around the world. Nine are in an advanced stage of testing. There are hopes we could have a working vaccine before the year’s end, although medical experts have been warning against too much optimism. Vaccines are the only thing that could save the tanker industry right now. If there is an effective vaccine and mass vaccinations, air travel will start to recover. If air travel starts to recover, so will overall oil demand. Yet it is worth noting that this will not happen overnight, even in the best-case scenario where a vaccine becomes widely available before the end of this year. Tanker owners are due more trouble before the situation returns to anything resembling the normal boom-and-bust cycle.",-0.9869,negative
Worlds No1 Oil Trader Sees Crude Inventories Shrinking This Year.html,"Vitol Group, the world’s largest independent oil trader, expects global oil inventories to continue drawing down for the rest of the year, unlike its rivals and many analysts who see a growing glut on the market. The world’s stockpiles of oil have diminished by around 300 million barrels since peaking at 1.2 billion barrels early this summer, and are expected to decline by another 250 million-300 million barrels between September and December, Vitol’s chief executive Russell Hardy told Bloomberg in an interview published on Wednesday. Refineries that have bought a lot of cheap oil in the past few months are expected to play a key role in drawing down global oil inventories, Hardy told Bloomberg.
 Gasoline demand could falter in the winter, but diesel demand could offset it, while jet fuel consumption still “looks bad,” Vitol’s top executive said, but added that demand recovery is likely to be uneven in the coming months. “Things may get a little more difficult before it gets better, but we do believe that we’ll get through it and things will steadily improve,” Hardy told Bloomberg. Vitol looks more bullish on oil’s short-term prospects than another major commodity trader, Trafigura, which expects a ""supply-heavy"" market through the end of the year, with inventories building by the end of 2020 as demand recovery stalls. 
 The market will get worse before it gets better, Ben Luckock, Co-Head of Oil Trading at Trafigura, said at a conference on Monday, as carried by Bloomberg. The oversupply on the market is reaching the point where chartering tankers for floating storage becomes profitable, according to Luckock. A resurgence of coronavirus cases in many parts of the world over the next few months will be the main hurdle to global demand for gasoline and diesel recovering to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, senior executives at oil firms and commodity traders said at the virtual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) earlier this week.  ",0.9243,positive
Oil Rises After EIA Confirms Crude Inventory Draw.html,"Crude oil prices inched up further today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 4.4 million barrels for the week to September 11. Fuel inventories were mixed. At 496 million barrels, the EIA said, crude oil stockpiles continue to be above the five-year average for this time of the year. Analysts had expected an inventory build of a bit over 2 million barrels for the period, after last week the EIA reported a build of the same amount for the first week of September. Gasoline inventories, the authority said, shed 400,000 barrels in the second week of September. That’s compared with a draw of 3 million barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 8.8 million bpd in the week to September 11, compared with 8.9 million bpd a week earlier.
 Driving season has been weak this year, unsurprisingly for many, although some still hoped that it would lead to major drawdowns in both crude oil and gasoline inventories in the world’s largest oil consumer. Once it ended, more builds can reasonably be expected. In distillate fuels, the situation remains precarious. Inventories added 3.5 million barrels in the second week of September, compared with a draw of 1.7 million barrels for each of the previous two weeks. Distillate production averaged 4.4 million bpd last week, virtually unchanged on a week earlier. That was down from 4.8 million bpd during the first week of September. Inventories remain about 20 percent above the five-year average as air travel remains constricted by pandemic-related restrictions and concerns. Oil prices have been depressed this week, as BP said the era of oil demand growth is very likely over and the IEA revised down its demand projections for this year, now expecting an 8.4-million-bpd contraction, down from an 8.1-million-bpd contraction it forecast in its August monthly report.
 Platform evacuation in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of Hurricane Sally provided some support for prices but it was only temporary as producers are ready to restart production quickly. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $41.44 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $39.23 a barrel, both up by more than 2 percent since opening.",-0.8641,negative
US Shale Production Continues To Decline.html,"Crude oil production in the U.S. shale patch is set to decline by 68,000 bpd next month, with every play registering declines in output except the Permian, the Energy Information Administration said in its latest Drilling Productivity Report. While production in the Permian is expected to increase by 23,000 bpd to 4,173 million barrels daily, output in the Niobrara shale play alone will offset this with an equal decline. In the Eagle Ford, production is set to decline by 28,000 bpd—the biggest decline—while production in the Anadarko, Bakken, and Appalachia plays is seen to fall by 20,000 bpd, 19,000 bpd, and 1,000 bpd, respectively.
 This means total shale oil production in October could average 7.64 million bpd daily next month, down from 7.708 million bpd this month. Oil production across U.S. shale plays fell sharply in late spring as the oil price collapse made a lot of wells unprofitable and even loss-making. With oil prices still around 40 percent below their levels from the start of the year and the outlook negative, the October decline may not be the last monthly one for the shale patch.
 The outlook on oil demand remains the single most negative factor for oil price, with the latest blow in this respect being BP’s 2020 Energy Outlook, according to which oil demand may never return to pre-pandemic levels, meaning the peak in global oil consumption might have been reached last year. Another bearish factor for prices was the pending reopening of Libya’s oil ports, which would signal an increase in production, too. Libya’s oil production has been slashed to less than 100,000 bpd amid the months-long blockade of the export terminals but reopening them will prompt a ramp-up in output. The reopening is not yet a done deal but the latest reports suggest it may only be a matter of time.",0.2302,positive
Second Wave Of COVID Could Crush Road Fuel Recovery.html,"A resurgence of coronavirus cases in many parts of the world over the next few months will be the main hurdle to global demand for gasoline and diesel recovering to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, according to senior executives at oil firms and commodity traders.    “A second wave or a continued set of outbreaks that has an impact on demand is ... the most likely shock that the oil market needs to be considering in the next 12 to 24 months,” Giovanni Serio, global head of research at oil trader Vitol, said at the virtual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC), as carried by Reuters. Many executives expect diesel and gasoline demand to return to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of next year, but how the pandemic will pan out is the major unknown in forecasts and a significant risk to the downside in case of many localized lockdowns.
 The industry professionals continue to be pessimistic about the recovery in jet fuel demand, which is expected to probably take up to three years to return to pre-crisis levels. According to the industry executives, refiners should recalibrate their product output away from jet fuel, if possible. In addition, the industry as a whole should be ready to have storage space available to keep excess oil and oil products if the demand recovery continues to wobble with uncertainties in the pandemic. One of the top independent traders, Trafigura, expects a “supply-heavy” market through the end of this year, with inventories building by the end of 2020 as demand recovery stalls. 
 The market will get worse before it gets better, Ben Luckock, Co-Head of Oil Trading at Trafigura, said on the conference on Monday, as carried by Bloomberg. The oversupply on the market is reaching the point where chartering tankers for floating storage becomes profitable, according to Trafigura’s executive.  ",-0.6173,negative
Traders Charter Supertankers Amid Signs Of New Oil Glut.html,"The world’s top oil traders have been chartering dozens of supertankers for potentially storing oil at sea amid signs that demand recovery has stalled.   Trafigura has chartered 12 very large crude carriers (VLCC), which can collectively hold 24 million barrels of oil, sources with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. Another 18 supertankers have also been booked by companies including Vitol Group, Shell, and Lukoil, according to lists of bookings of shipbrokers seen by Bloomberg. BP is said to have provisionally booked a supertanker to hold oil in floating storage offshore Malaysia, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing Refinitiv Eikon data and industry sources.
 BP managed to snap up the supertanker at the lowest rate so far this year, according to the data, at $20,500 per day for three months, with the option to extend the charter for another three months at $22,000 per day, according to one of Reuters’ sources. Day rates for supertankers have tripled in a week, TankerTrackers.com co-founder Samir Madani said. While there is movement in the supertanker charter market, some of it could be attributed to the widening contango in the oil futures curve, but some could just be the low freight rates, compared to this year’s highs at the end of March and early April when demand was crashing while Saudi Arabia was on a tanker-chartering spree to flood the market with oil.
 “Much of the recent temptation to lease vessels for storage reflects more the decline in freight rates than a return to super contango,” analysts at Citi told Reuters. Yet, in recent weeks, the contango—in which prices for delivery at later dates are higher than front-month prices that typically points to oversupply—has deepened, and starting to open the so-called ‘contango plays’ in which oil traders store oil to sell it at a profit at a later stage.

Floating Storage Begins To Fill Up As Oil Demand Wavers.html,"Huge floating oil storage builds earlier this year became a major cause for oil price falls as the pandemic wiped out demand. Then, as OPEC+ started cutting production and countries began emerging from lockdowns, floating storage inventories began to decline, boosting prices. Now, they’re creeping up again--but this time, it’s fuel inventories. Commodity major Trafigura recently chartered at least five Very Large Crude Carriers, each capable of carrying up to 2 million barrels of oil or fuels, according to a Reuters report that cited shipping data and unnamed trading sources. Some of these were newbuilds, too. They are most likely going to be used to store gasoil and diesel, according to the report, as inventories of these two fuels were particularly high. And Trafigura’s peers are booking tankers, too. It’s not just diesel and gasoil. All distillate fuel stocks are a problem. In the United States, refiners have been struggling with rising distillate inventories for weeks now as air travel remains severely restricted, jet fuel demand is in the ditch, and there are no alternative venues for the oil product. Refiners have been raising their gasoline production, but demand for gasoline has also been slow to recover and inventories there also remain above the five-year average despite several hefty draws.
 The trend is certainly worrying for those banking on an oil price rebound driven by fuel demand recovery, which is pretty much everyone who produces fuels. Demand was expected to recover more or less consistently after the lockdowns barring a second wave of infections. But while some countries have indeed experienced what looks like two distinct waves of Covid-19 infections, for others, including the world’s largest oil consumer globally, the U.S., it has been a single but prolonged wave. Uncertainty about pretty much everything from employment to vaccine development remains ample, and this is affecting oil demand.  Related: The Nine Key Points In Biden’s Energy Strategy Normally, traders start hoarding oil—or oil products—when prices are low but are expected to rise in the future. There is a decent degree of certainty prices will rise because that’s how things work in oil. This is all in the past now. Earlier this year, storage builds were so abundant that some began to worry the world would run out of storage space. Prices tanked. Now, traders can only hope that prices will improve in the future and they won’t suffer losses from storing fuels. “It is increasingly clear that market fundamentals are not improving as quickly as expected, particularly on the demand side,” Morgan Stanley’s Martijn Rats said in a recent note, as quoted by Reuters. He added that despite a stable draw in crude oil and fuel stocks, these remain at historic highs, with this particularly true for fuels, which, according to Rats, stayed at “stubbornly” high levels.
 What this suggests is that refiners restarted crude buying earlier this year in anticipation of a rebound in demand for fuels. This rebound, however, never came to pass, and now refiners—and commodity traders—are stuck with millions of barrels of fuels they can’t sell. What makes things worse is that the latest data on oil demand, particularly from China, is not encouraging at all. Earlier this month Saudi Arabia’s Aramco served an unpleasant surprise to oil markets by announcing it was sharply cutting its official selling prices for oil. The cuts would affect Asian, U.S., and northwestern European clients. Meanwhile, worry has been growing that China had stuffed itself with cheap oil and its buying spree, which helped prices stay stable during the summer, was coming to an end. When one of the world’s top oil producers, which has so far been rather upbeat about the future of oil demand, slashes its prices, it speaks volumes. In all public statements, Aramco’s leadership has been confident that oil demand was recovering nicely, about to reach pre-crisis levels sooner rather than later. The company even raised its prices for Asian buyers earlier this year, boosting benchmarks. Now, it’s cutting prices. Add to this the news from China and the picture becomes grimmer. Economists have been talking about L-shaped, V-shaped, and W-shaped recovery scenarios for the U.S. and global economy. The oil market appears to be stuck in a sort of recovery that no letter fits.",-0.9807,negative
Traffic Levels In Europe And Asia Near Pre COVID Levels.html,"Many major cities in Europe and Asia have started to see the return of the rush-hour congestions in recent weeks, suggesting that people are using their cars more to travel to work and drop children off at school. This rise in traffic in cities such as London point to a mixed picture of global road fuel demand, Javier Blas of Bloomberg News reports, citing data from navigation company TomTom International. Traffic in parts of Europe and Asia is nearly back to the levels seen before the pandemic, while North and South America are not seeing much rush-hour traffic yet. In the UK, for example, some cities are already seeing rush-hour traffic return to levels seen last year, according to data analyzed by The Times. The UK is encouraging people and companies to return to offices to help the economy.
 Some companies in Europe are paying employees cash to use their own vehicles or take a cab to their workplaces. This week, traffic in London and Paris was at its highest since March, while traffic has also surged in recent weeks in major cities such as Munich, Berlin, and Vienna. While traffic in major cities in Europe and China is now just 15 percent below levels seen last year, in the U.S., Canada, and South America, city traffic is still 50 percent off last year’s levels, according to Bloomberg estimates of data from TomTom. Given the large share of the U.S. of global road fuel consumption, the muted traffic in U.S. cities is a concern about the global oil demand recovery.
 This recovery appears to have stalled, and the end of the driving season in the United States and upcoming refinery maintenance do not bode well for oil demand in the coming months either. The faltering oil demand recovery in recent weeks has soured sentiment on the market, sending oil prices tumbling earlier this week.  ",0.5245,positive
Is This South Americas Next Oil Drilling Hotspot.html,"The oil industry in South America is in sever need of positive stimuli – the Argentinian shale wonder has just survived a near-collapse of its government only to be stalled by the coronavirus, Venezuela is falling ever lower, whilst Colombia is struggling to kickstart its oft-lauded shale bounty. Suriname, a Dutch-speaking nation of some 600 000 people, might become just that, South America’s next drilling hotspot. The previous Guyana has had a phenomenal string of successes with its exploratory wells, up until 2020 18 out of the total 20 wells spudded wielded commercially exploitable reserves. Could neighboring Suriname follow in Guyana’s footsteps with an equally awe-inspiring drilling tally? So far it seems that there is every reason to believe it can. There are two major differences between Suriname and Guyana. The first, and perhaps less important, is that Suriname has been producing some crude from onshore assets since the 1930s, thus oil would not come as an entire novelty for the South American nation’s authorities. The second is that Suriname has had to struggle its way through initial disillusionment, the path to success was by no means immediate and linear. Just as Guyana’s Liza discovery was heating up interest towards the Guyana-Suriname basin, Kosmos Energy drilled the Anapai and Pontoenoe wildcats in 2017 – the first encountered high quality reservoirs but no hydrocarbons, whilst the second found hydrocarbons but was water-bearing. Apache, too, had had unsuccessful wildcats in 2015 and 2017 at Block 53 before starting off a string of high-profile discoveries. Suriname’s hopes of it replicating Guyana’s success were further boosted by the Apache’s latest discovery. The Kwaskwasi-1 well was spudded in a water depth of some 1000 metres to a total depth of 6645 metres, using the Noble Sam Croft drillship. This discovery might be one of the highlights of the entire Guyana-Suriname Basin, having found 278 meters of net oil and an oil/gas condensate in two intervals – a 63 meters net oil pay and 86 meters of net volatile oil/gas condensate pay in the shallower Campanian interval, and a 129 meters net oil pay in the deeper Santonian interval. Kwaskwasi became the third Apache-Total discovery this year, joining the ranks of Maka and Sapakara (both of which had exceeded expectations).  Related: The Start Of A New Oil Market Supercycle
  Source: Apache. The first one to take place in Suriname’s offshore, the Maka Central discovery buoyed Latin America watchers as the exploratory well unearthed a 73 metres net oil pay and not gas-condensate (as the adjacent Haimara field in offshore Guyana), with crude density oscillating within the 35-40° API. The discovery of Maka was announced in January 2020, today Suriname’s stature seems even brighter. All of Suriname’s Block 58 discoveries were carried out by the same drillship, Noble Sam Croft. All three discoveries wield net pays exceeding 60 meters, with crude qualities roughly conforming to the 35-45° API interval (i.e. lighter than Guyana’s Liza). In the light of such drilling results, perhaps Apache’s claims that it had identified at least 7 play types solely within Block 58, with more than 50 potential drilling prospects, no longer seems that naïve or idealistic.
 The drilling success will also aid the administration of Chandrikapersad Santokhi, Suriname’s new president after Desi Bouterse accepted his defeat and decided to steer clear of further confrontation. Given the shaky character of the transit – the troubled South American country still lacks a tradition of seamless power transfers – as well as recent indication that Guyana might move to revisit its upstream terms, Santokhi’s government is not expected to change the currently existing upstream terms so as to consolidate its international stature. Moreover, having chosen Ronnie Brunswijk as his vice president (formerly the bodyguard of Bouterse, turned into the “Robin Hood of Suriname” as Bouterse burned down his native village in the 1986 Moiwana massacre), there will be enough internal reckoning not to jeopardize foreign investment. The probability that Suriname will witness another substantial discovery following Kwaskwasi is quite high. Apache has signaled its intent to spud the Keskesi East-1 well (the fourth prospect within Block 58) right after the Noble Sam Croft drillship finished operations on Kwaskwasi. Keskesi is located some 9 miles from Sapakara, with Apache targeting the oil-prone upper Cretaceous deposits. Interestingly, Apache remains the operator of Block 58 it had farmed down 50% of interest to Total in December 2019 – the French major paid an upright $100 million bonus and committed to pay a quarterly royalty on the first 1.5 billion barrels of gross production (the royalty moves between 0.25 and 0.5 per barrel subject to the quarterly Brent average). Once Keskesi is drilled, Total would also take over the operatorship of Block 58. Following Apache’s drilling streak, the next move in Suriname’s offshore will be the spudding of the Petronas-operated Sloanea-1 well in Block 52, expected to take place in Q4 2020 using the Maersk Developer semi-submersible rig. Up until this May Petronas was the sole stakeholder in the given acreage only to farm down 50% of participating interest to ExxonMobil, i.e. if drilling within the given block also results in discoveries, the US major would expand its working acreage to both Guyana and Suriname. Tullow’s drilling the Goliathberg-Voltzberg North (also abbreviated as GVN) on Block 47 in Q1 2021, with first results expected to emerge after 2-3 months of drilling. For Tullow and its Block 47 partners (the Argentinian Pluspetrol that owns 30% and the Israeli Ratio Oil owning 20%) this will be a much symbolic move as its previous exploratory well (Araku-1) failed to find any commercial deposits.",0.7059,positive
Surprise Crude Build Forces Oil Prices Lower.html,"The slide in crude oil prices accelerated after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory build of 2 million barrels for the week to September 4. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute added gloom to an already pessimistic market by reporting an inventory build of 2.97 million barrels for the same period. Analysts had expected the EIA to report a moderate draw of a little over 1 million barrels.
 A week earlier, the EIA reported a draw of 9.4 million barrels in crude oil, along with a solid decline in gasoline stocks and a more moderate one in distillate fuels. The latter are becoming a problem for refiners as their inventories remain high amid even more subdued demand than that for gasoline. For last week, the EIA reported a draw of 3 million barrels in gasoline and a decline of 1.7 million barrels in distillate fuels. This is compared with a 4.3-million-barrel decline in gasoline stocks a week earlier and a 1.7-million-barrel draw in distillate fuel stocks. Gasoline production last week averaged 8.9 million barrels daily, while distillate fuel production stood at some 4.4 million barrels daily. This is compared with 9.5 million bpd of gasoline and 4.8 million bpd of distillate fuels in the previous week.
 Oil prices have been on a losing streak this week after optimism about the recovery in oil demand got crushed amid doubts about China’s capacity to continue buying record-high amounts of crude and as Saudi Arabia said it would reduce its prices sharply for Asian and U.S. buyers from October, signaling a marked change in its upbeat attitude from earlier this year. Yesterday, prices recouped some of their earlier losses thanks to a rebound in stock markets, but fears that demand recovery prospects have been overestimated remained, putting a ceiling on benchmarks.

Trumps Drilling Ban Bombshell Rocks Oil Industry.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump shocked the oil industry today with a surprise announcement that he would extend the existing moratorium on oil drilling on parts of Florida’s, South Carolina’s, and Georgia’s coast, according to Politico. The announcement was a complete surprise, according to Politico, even to congressional aides, lobbyists, and industry officials who have been working on this very issue. The announcement is a complete shift from the White House’s previous stance, which sought to open up those areas to oil drilling, although most had expected the President to wait until after the election. President Trump had declared his intention to open up those areas to drilling years ago, but Florida’s Governor Rick Scott at the time—a Republican—was a staunch opponent of the plan, citing his state’s strong tourism industry.
 Rick Scott now serves as a Senator. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, also a Republican, is a fierce opponent to opening up these areas to oil drilling as well. Back in 2018, Florida voters weren’t so sure how they felt about a ban on offshore oil drilling; 54% of voters were in favor of a ban, while 42% were against. Florida’s 29 electoral votes will be hard fought for on the campaign trail this year as a critical swing state, and it appears that the White House views the battleground state as anti-coastal drilling.  Related: Oil Prices Tank On Global Demand Concerns According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) analysis of API polling data, however, the oil industry has strong support in key battleground states, with 93 percent of voters in critical states seeing it as important for the U.S. to produce enough energy to keep it from relying on foreign oil, while 92% believe that keeping oil and gasoline prices affordable is important. 82% of voters recognize the value that oil and gas have on their lives, and 73% believe that nat gas and oil will still be a significant part of America’s energy needs in 2040. What’s more, 63% believe that the nat gas and oil industries will be critical for helping the economy recover from the current pandemic.
 For Florida specifically, nearly two-thirds of Florida voters—including a majority of Democrats, say they would be “more likely to vote for a candidate who supports access to oil and gas produced in the U.S.” 82% of Florida voters support continued investments in the oil industry, while 84% want to minimize harm to the environment.

Global Oil Demand To Return To Pre Crisis Levels In Three Years.html,"It will take three years for global oil demand to rebound to pre-pandemic levels, as jet fuel consumption continues to trend much lower than last year’s levels, according to Bank of America Securities.   While road fuel demand has recovered to nearly pre-COVID-19 levels, aviation fuel demand is struggling to take off materially as air travel is still significantly down compared to ‘normal’ levels from before the pandemic, BofAS said in a weekly energy reported carried by TradeArabia. Air travel will not rebound until an effective vaccine or cure for COVID-19 is rolled out, the BofAS analysts said. An effective vaccine, however, is still 12 to 18 months down the line, according to the bank. Data from global flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed last week that in August, commercial flights made it up to 45.2 percent below August 2019 levels, but grew at a much slower pace than June and July.
 If a vaccine is rolled out at the end of 2021, air travel would recover to 75 percent of pre-crisis levels in 2022 and to 90 percent of the typical consumption level in 2023, BofAS says. For the longer term, the bank sees global oil demand peaking at some 105 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2030, due to the rising share of electric vehicles (EVs) in light duty vehicle sales. BofAS’ base-case scenario is EVs taking a 34-percent share of light vehicle sales by 2030 and 95 percent of sales by 2050.  Related: Big Oil Sees Major Potential In Suriname Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles could also displace part of oil demand for transportation, especially if green hydrogen prices fall materially, according to BofAS. In the near term, oil demand recovery appears to have stalled, due to weak refining margins, a lack of recovery in jet fuel demand, and uncertainties over global economic growth, including in the world’s top oil importer, China, the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Director for Energy Markets and Security, Keisuke Sadamori, said earlier this week.
 In a sign that demand recovery is faltering, the world’s top oil exporter Saudi Arabia cut its official selling prices for crude oil for October. “Clearly this suggests that the market is not tightening as quickly as many had anticipated, with supply edging higher, and with demand clearly faltering,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Tuesday.

This, it is hoped, clears the way for Suriname to access what is believed to be its considerable petroleum resources, which if correctly exploited could transform the deeply impoverished South American country. Suriname is one of the poorest countries in South America with a gross domestic product per capita of $6,855 for 2019, which is lower than Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. It is wealthier on this measure than neighboring Guyana which is undergoing what could become South America’s largest oil boom and was also mired in a political crisis until last month. The former Dutch colony shares with its neighbor the offshore Guyana-Suriname Basin, which the US Geological Survey (USGS) estimates to hold almost 14 billion barrels of oil and 32 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Toward the end of 2019, the agency stated that it planned to reappraise the basin during 2020, although that may be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Source: JHI & Associates. The part of the basin located in Suriname’s territorial waters is under-explored and energy companies have not experienced the same degree of success as Exxon, Hess, and Tullow in Guyana. It is, however, believed that the USGS has underestimated the basin’s hydrocarbon potential, and recoverable oil and natural gas resources could substantially exceed its original estimates.
 The Guyana-Suriname Basin’s considerable hydrocarbon potential is demonstrated by ExxonMobil’s multiple significant oil discoveries in Guyana’s offshore Stabroek Block. Those saw the energy major upgrade its recoverable resources in offshore Guyana to more than eight million barrels at the start of 2020. This is further underscored by Tullow’s success in offshore Guyana which saw CEO Paul McDade state in a September 2019 conference call; “The whole area appears to be characterized by excellent quality reservoirs.” Related: The Threat Of Oil Nationalism In Argentina Indications are that Suriname’s own oil boom is finally gaining momentum. Apache Corporation announced a major oil discovery at its Block 58 in offshore Suriname at the end of July 2020. That came on the back of two earlier discoveries in the same Block in January and April 2020 respectively. The January Maka Central-1 discovery was the first offshore oil find in Suriname. Apache has prioritized Suriname as it seeks to capitalize on those oil discoveries and replicate Exxon’s success at the offshore Liza oil field in the Stabroek block in neighboring Guyana. Apache, along with Block 58 partner oil major Total, has identified 50 prospects in the 1.4 million offshore block and plans to conduct further exploratory drilling at the Keskesi target. Source: Staatsolie. Exxon is seeking to replicate the substantial success it has enjoyed in offshore Guyana in Suriname. In 2017 the integrated oil major established a production sharing agreement with Suriname’s national oil company Staatsolie for offshore Block 59 with partners Hess and Statoil. That deepwater asset shares a maritime boundary with Guyana, meaning that Exxon can leverage off the infrastructure it has established for the world-class Liza oil field in Guyana’s offshore Stabroek Block. Exxon acquired a 50% interest in Block 52 offshore Suriname toward the end of May this year from Malaysian integrated energy major Petronas, which owns the remaining 50% and is the operator.
  Related: The Complete Breakdown Of Russian Output Cuts It is easy to understand the attractiveness of offshore Suriname in the current difficult operating environment weighed down by sharply weaker oil prices. Hess claims that its offshore production in Guyana has a breakeven price of $35 per barrel making those assets potentially profitable even with Brent at $42 a barrel. The ability to leverage off the experience gained in Guyana and infrastructure put in place means the breakeven price for offshore production in Suriname could be even lower, especially as drilling techniques improve, and operational efficiencies are realized. This highlights why foreign oil companies led by Apache, Total Exxon, Hess, Tullow, and Petronas are investing heavily in offshore Suriname oil assets. For as long as oil prices are caught in a protracted slump, jurisdictions like Suriname and Guyana which have low breakeven prices will remain the focus of energy majors. Suriname’s national oil company Staatsolie regulates the former Dutch colony’s oil industry, including awarding concessions to foreign oil companies and establishing production agreements. Staatsolie has announced that it intends to tap bond markets in 2020 intending to raise up to $2 billion to fund exploration and development activities. The national oil company has also flagged listing stock on a major global exchange to raise further capital, much like the national oil companies of Brazil (Petrobras) and Colombia (Ecopetrol) have done. That indicates the national oil company is getting ready to fund further activities aimed at boosting investment in Suriname’s burgeoning oil industry. These are important developments for deeply impoverished Suriname. If the current tempo of operations can be maintained it is likely that the former Dutch colony will, like neighboring Guyana, be on track to benefit from considerable oil wealth. This will be transformative for a country that is facing an economic disaster because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF expects Suriname’s GDP to contract by almost 5% in 2020 compared to Guyana’s soaring by roughly 53% because of its oil boom. Those numbers underscore the tremendous benefits available to the impoverished former Dutch colony if it can exploit the substantial hydrocarbon wealth which exists within its territory. The change in government bodes well for a more stable, business-friendly environment which will promote economic growth while ratcheting down political and regulatory risk for foreign investors.",0.9941,positive
The Complete Breakdown Of Russian Output Cuts.html,"The OPEC+ deal, concluded in April amid falling global demand, may lead to a double-digit decline in Russian crude oil production for the first time in more than 25 years. Having increased in 2018 by 1.7% (to 555.9 million tons), and in 2019 - by 0.9% (to 561.2 million tons), the production of oil and gas condensate in the first seven months of 2020 decreased by 6.4% in annual terms, to 304.4 million tons (hereinafter, Refinitiv data is given with reference to the Energy Ministry’s CDU TEK unit). Moreover, in the second quarter, production fell by 10.3% compared to the same period last year (to 124.3 million tons), and in July - by 15.9% (to 39.7 million tons). The effect of the April agreement is clearly seen in the statistics of daily production provided by the already mentioned CDU TEK (all values presented below are converted by a 7.33 barrel-per-ton ratio). Between March and April, the average daily production of oil and gas condensate increased by 0.4%, to 11.34 million barrels per day (bpd), while between April and May it decreased by 17.1%, to 9.40 million bpd, remaining close to this level both in June (9.33 million bpd) and July (9.38 million bpd). A Chronicle of the Fall The same dynamic is typical for the Big Four of the Russian oil industry. Between April and May, Rosneft (excluding Bashneft) and Lukoil reduced production by 15.7% and 20.6%, respectively (to 3.22 million and 1.33 million bpd), while Surgutneftegas and Gazprom Neft (excluding Slavneft) - by 22.7% (to 1.00 million bpd) and 20.1% (to 0.71 million bpd). In June and July, Rosneft produced daily 15% and 12% less than in April, while Lukoil - by 20.8% and 19.6%, respectively, Gazprom Neft - by 20% and 14.7%, and Surgutneftegas - by 23.7% in both months.

Thus, Tatneft, the fifth largest Russian oil producer, in July produced just 1.7% less per day than in April (479,000 bpd versus 487,000 bpd), while Slavneft, which is owned by Rosneft and Gazprom Neft on parity terms, cut production by more than half during the same period (from 297,000 bpd to 143,000 bpd). For RussNeft and NNK (companies that are at the bottom of the top fifteen largest producers) the dynamics differ just as strongly: the former reduced daily production by 18.7% between April and July (from 142,000 to 115,000 bpd), while the latter cut output by just 0.5% (from 40,400 to 40,200 bpd). Brownfields VS Greenfields Which regions contributed most to the production decline? To find out, you need to look at the companies’ subsidiaries. The largest ones operate in Western Siberia, such as RN-Yuganskneftegaz, which cut production by 7.6% between April and July (from 1.35 million to 1.25 million bpd) or Lukoil-Western Siberia and Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz, which reduced production by 25.2% (from 692,000 to 518,000 bpd) and 32.9% (from 282,000 to 190,000 bpd) over the same period. This also includes the West Siberian fields of Surgutneftegas formally located in the Urals Federal District: between April and July, their production decreased by 28%, from 1.10 million to 0.79 million bpd.  Related: String Of Bearish News Shifts Sentiment In Oil Markets The Volga-Ural oil and gas province, the oldest in Russia, has not avoided a drop in production either. Lukoil-Komi, one of Lukoil’s two local subsidiaries, cut production by 25.2% between April and July (from 336,000 to 251,000 bpd), while the other, Lukoil-Perm, slashed output by 13.1% (from 306,000 to 266,000 bpd). In turn, Orenburgneft, the key subsidiary of Rosneft in the Volga Federal District, reduced production by 39% over the same period (from 279,000 to 170,000 bpd), and neighboring Samaraneftegaz - by 12.2% (from 252,000 to 222,000 bpd). Bashneft-Dobycha, the largest subsidiary of Bashneft operating in the same District, cut production in half (from 328,000 bpd in April to 148,000 bpd in July). The decline in oil production has not spared three other large regions. The first one is Yamal, where Gazpromneft-Yamal, which is developing the Novoportovskoye field, cut production by 7.5% between April and July (from 160,000 to 148,000 bpd). The second one is Eastern Siberia, where local subsidiaries of Rosneft, RN-Vankor and Verkhnechonskneftegaz, reduced production by 5.9% (from 238,000 to 224,000 bpd) and 5.5% (from 159,000 to 150,000 bpd) over the same period. The third one is the Far East, where Exxon Neftegas Limited, the operator of the Sakhalin-1 PSA project, reduced production by 12.8% (from 262,000 to 228,000 bpd), and Sakhalin Energy, the operator of the Sakhalin-2 PSA project, - by 18.3% (from 108,000 to 88,000 bpd). The operator of another PSA project, Zarubezhneft-Dobycha Kharyaga, which is developing the Kharyaginskoye field in the Nenets Autonomous Region, cut production by 23.9% (from 35,000 bpd in April to 27,000 bpd in July). However, the drop in production has not affected several fields that were launched recently. This includes the major Prirazlomnoye field in the Arctic, at which Gazprom Neft Shelf increased production by 16.6% between April and July (from 64,000 to 75,000 bpd), as well as the Tagulskoye field in Eastern Siberia, where Rosneft's eponymous subsidiary has more than doubled its production (from 22,000 bpd in April to 47,000 bpd in July), and the Surgutneftegas fields in Yakutia, where production increased by 0.3% (from 198,000 to 199,000 bpd for the same period). But this hasn’t changed the game: between April and July, Russia’s daily production fell by 17.3% (from 11.34 million to 9.38 million bpd). Production Slide Weighs On Oil Exports The double-digit output drop has taken its toll on crude exports too. Russia has seen its exports decrease by 8.6% year-on-year in the first seven months of 2020 (from 153.9 million to 140.7 million tons), while in the second quarter they fell by 9.4% (from 65.2 million to 59.1 million tons), and in July - by 25% (from 23.1 million to 17.3 million tons). Coupled with the collapse in prices, this led to a 34.8% decrease in total revenues from crude oil exports in the first half of the year (to $38.9 billion, according to the Federal Customs Service). As a result, 2020 now seems to be the most difficult year for the Russian oil industry since the early 1990s, when the industry was experiencing a double-digit decline. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all oil producing nations hard, and Russia is no exception.",-0.9635,negative
IEA Oil Demand Recovery Has Stalled.html,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) joined the chorus of analysts saying that the pace of global oil demand recovery has stalled in recent weeks on the back of weak refining margins, a lack of recovery in jet fuel demand, and uncertainties over global economic growth, including in the world’s top oil importer, China. Although the IEA doesn’t forecast major slowdowns in demand going forward, global oversupply has yet to show strong signs of drawdowns, Keisuke Sadamori, Director, Energy Markets and Security at the IEA, told Reuters. “It doesn’t seem like a massive stock draw seems to be happening yet,” Sadamori told Reuters, noting that “We are not seeing a robust pickup in refining activity, and jet fuel is the big problem.”
 Uncertainties over the course of China’s economy and by extension, oil demand, are also weighing on the oil market, according to the official. In its latest Oil Market Report for August, the IEA downgraded its oil demand forecast for this year by 140,000 bpd compared to the estimate from the previous month’s report. This was the first downgrade in several months, “reflecting the stalling of mobility as the number of Covid-19 cases remains high, and weakness in the aviation sector,” the IEA said.   The IEA expected in the middle of August that crude oil demand this year would be 8.1 million bpd lower than it was in 2019.
 The market will be waiting for the most recent assessment from the IEA in its next report scheduled to be released on September 15. OPEC also revised down its oil demand forecast in August, pointing to still struggling fuel demand and continued high uncertainty about the pandemic’s impact on economies and mobility. The wobbling pace of oil demand recovery and the uncertainties over economic growth in major economies have weighed down on oil prices recently. Last week, oil prices slumped to register their largest weekly decline since June. ",-0.9517,negative
Saudi Arabia To Cut Oil Prices As Demand Fears Grow.html,"Saudi Arabia has cut its official selling prices for crude oil in the latest sign that demand recovery is stumbling, Bloomberg reports, adding that this is the first time Riyadh has cut its oil prices to a discount against the benchmark since June. Prices were lowered both for Asian and U.S. buyers this time, after Aramco kept its prices higher for U.S. refiners for six months in a row. For Asian buyers, this was the second consecutive month of price cuts, which suggests that the appetite for Saudi oil is dwindling after Chinese refiners spent the better part of the year stocking up on cheap crude amid the price crash and the pandemic. In China, a key market, Saudi Arabia has been losing market share to its geopolitical partner, the United States, over the last few months. China has imported record volumes of crude oil in recent months, taking advantage of the lowest crude prices in two decades in April to stock up on dirt-cheap oil. 
 In their bargain-hunting for low-priced oil, Chinese state oil giants and independent refiners alike snapped up cheap U.S. cargoes in April, which were loaded in May, started to arrive in China in June, and set records in July.  Meanwhile, Saudi oil exports to the U.S. hit the lowest in more than three decades by August this year, down to an average daily of 177,000 bpd from some 1.3 million bpd in April. This month, Saudi oil imports into the U.S. are seen lower still, at some 264,000 bpd, which would be the lowest since 1985. Just a month ago, Aramco’s chief executive said he was optimistic about the recovery of oil demand in Asia, seeing it almost back to pre-crisis levels. This followed earlier comments by Amin Nasser in June that the worst of the crisis was over, and the second half of the year would be much more robust in terms of oil demand than the first.
 Based on the latest price adjustments, for shipments in October, this may not turn out to be the case.",-0.9859,negative
US Shale Recovery Leans On Huge Inventory Of DUCs.html,"The recovery of fracking operations in the US is happening largely thanks to an unusually high inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs), which is strong enough to sustain the current level of fracking without the industry adding more rigs to expand drilling deep into 2021, a Rystad Energy analysis shows. After DUCs run out, however, rig activity in the five key oil regions needs to be in the 280-300 range to maintain flat oil output. Actual rig activity today is almost 50% lower than that requirement, but the industry still has about two to three-quarters of leverage, based on the current DUC count, to achieve a smooth transition from a DUC-driven activity phase to a regular operations mode. The Permian Basin, where the recovery in fracking has been most pronounced, can still accommodate 13 months of activity at last month’s pace. With a normal DUC-to-fracking ratio of about five months, this implies that Permian operators are carrying an inventory that is equivalent to eight months of fracking at the current pace. Thus, even if drilling operations in the basin stop completely, Permian fracking can be maintained at about 200-250 wells per month through the first half of next year before the inventory size returns to normal. The nationwide DUC inventory reached a peak of about 5,800 wells before starting to decline in July.  Drilling activity fell across all major oil basins – Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara and Anadarko – in the March to May period. Fracking hit a bottom in May and stayed at that low in June before recovering sharply in July. As the rig count fell steadily through to early July, and with no material efficiency gains realized in the first months of the downturn, total depth count posted a sequential decline in July with just above 200 wells drilled in all oil basins combined.
 The oil basin inventory increased by about 650 horizontal wells between February and June, subsequently declining by about 140 in July. It is expected that the declining trend will last through the rest of this year, reaching pre-COVID numbers across all regions before the end of the year. Still, given that fracking remains far below the pre-COVID level, the size of the existing inventory is much higher than what should be expected for the current level of activity.  Related: What Explains The Sudden Drop In Oil Prices? The inventory-to-fracking-run-rate ratio hovered at about five months through 2018 and 2019, widely considered a normal level based on the cycle time of a typical unconventional drilling and completion operation. In the second quarter, this ratio increased to an unprecedented level of two-three years of fracking at the current pace in all oil basins. Even after the recovery in activity in July, the inventory is equivalent to 13 months of fracking in the Permian Basin and 22 months across the rest of the regions. The oil DUC inventory structure today is very different from how it looked just a year ago. In the Permian Basin, the share of DUCs drilled less than six months ago declined to 55% in July from 72% in the same month a year earlier. The share of DUCs drilled six to 11 months earlier increased to 24% from 9% in the same period. Hence, there are more than 700 Permian DUCs that were drilled in the second half of last year that remains uncompleted as of today – an unprecedented number in the basin’s history. A similar picture is evident in other oil basins where the share of young wells (drilled less than six months ago) declined from 62% to 36% with many wells drilled in the second half of last year remaining uncompleted. Besides the Permian Basin, there is also a material increase in the share of DUCs that were drilled 12-23 months ago, from 3% to 13%. These DUCs, however, faced an unusual challenge of persistent gas infrastructure bottlenecks in the Niobrara region in 2018-2019.
 “Fracking activity for the rest of this year and early 2021 will be supported by the existing, abnormally high level of DUCs, though not all DUCs will be brought online quickly. Large, well-established operators will stay committed to capital discipline, only increasing their completion spend gradually in the current price environment,” says Artem Abramov, Rystad Energy’s Head of Shale Research. But as the DUC inventory gets depleted, we estimate that about 190 rigs will be needed in Permian, out of the nationwide total of about 280-300, to maintain flat production next year compared with its current count of about 125 rigs. As new well performance remains at a record high, maintenance activity requirement will follow the base decline trend. In early 2020, the industry had to put on production more than 850 horizontal wells, across the five major oil regions, to keep production flat. We anticipate that the maintenance activity requirement will fall to 450-500 wells by mid-2021. Meanwhile, a large group of shale-focused E&Ps face financial distress or have already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A vast majority of these companies will not be able to return to a reasonable capex and activity level before their debt restructuring is finalized, which typically takes about six to 12 months.",0.9906,positive
Big Oils Risky Plastic Bet Could Lead To 400 Billion In Stranded Assets.html,"Oil companies are risking some $400 billion in stranded assets with their focus on petrochemicals production growth that relies on strong growth in demand for plastics, Carbon Tracker has said in a new report. “The oil industry is pinning its hopes on strong plastics demand growth that will not materialise, as the world starts to tackle plastic waste and governments act to hit climate targets,” the organization said. Big Oil companies are banking on demand for plastics replacing much of the demand for oil from the transport sector as EVs displace internal combustion engines. But Carbon Tracker’s The Future’s Not in Plastics report suggests that growth in plastics demand will actually be much weaker than Big Oil needs because of an expected shift “from a linear plastic system to a circular one and governments act to hit climate targets.”
 If this proves true, it will make for terrible news for the oil industry. While the major displacement of oil demand in the transport sector has yet to materialize as EV penetration has been slower than major projections estimated, the crusade against plastics has begun and will only intensify in the coming years. This would mean more initiatives for banning single-use plastics and more regulation in place for plastics recycling. Without regulation, the crusade will fail. According to Carbon Tracker, however, it will win, not least because of problems inherent in the plastics industry. “Plastics impose a massive untaxed externality upon society which this report estimates is about $1,000 per tonne ($350bn a year) from carbon dioxide, health costs, collection costs, and ocean pollution,” the report’s authors wrote, adding that these can be mitigated through recycling, replacing with alternative materials, and improving the design and regulation.
 If demand for plastics falls, then some 80 million tons of new plastics production capacity worth $400 billion will be stranded, the report warns.",-0.2732,negative
30 Years Of Drilling Data Points To A Rebound In US Oil Production.html,"While speculation continues about whether drilling activity in the U.S. oil patch has hit rock bottom yet, some analysts believe that the industry is already on the path to recovery. Reuters analyst John Kemp expects drilling rates to start picking up in September and October, with production beginning to recover in the second quarter of 2021.  Kemp states that over the last 30 years, changes in futures prices have typically been followed by changes in drilling with an average delay of 4-5 months, while changes in output usually materialized after 9-12 months.Given the run up in WTI crude prices during the months of May and June, some drillers are now beginning to bring back shut-in production and are already preparing new drilling programs for this fall. According to data from Rystad Energy, the pace of reactivation of curtailments has accelerated since July, with most operators planning to bring back all shuttered production in September.  Large U.S. shale firms such as EOG Resources and Parsley Energy are not just looking to bring back production from shuttered wells, but are also planning to “accelerate” production in the second half of 2020. Early indicators for drilling activity, such as the Baker Hughes rig count and Primary Vision’s frac spread (a more direct indicator of hydraulic fracturing fleets in the field), are reflecting a cautious uptick in drilling activity during the last two weeks of August. 
  According to Kemp, the U.S. rig count is poised to recover during Q3 and Q4 of this year as drillers begin to react to improving prices which have brought a period of relative stability and low volatility to oil markets.   Related: Two Major Shale Drillers Plan Layoffs Oil production, however, will continue to plunge during the next couple of months, impacted by the still low drilling rate and the 50-60 percent annual decline rate seen in many shale wells. 
 It’s tough to say exactly when production will turn around. $40 WTI might not be enough to fuel the next shale boom, but $50+ oil could entice a large number of companies to expand drilling activity.  The global crude demand recovery and the course of oil prices in Q3 and Q4 will play a major role in the decision-making process of U.S. drilling firms, and a lot will depend on the cash-flow outlook of individual wells. While even the EIA remains negative on the prospect of a quick rebound in U.S. production, more positive analysts generally expect the inflection point to be somewhere at the end of Q1 2021. With both OPEC+ and U.S. producers bringing production back to the market, it remains unclear whether there’s demand for these additional barrels or if a new wave of crude will result in yet another price meltdown.",-0.706,negative
Why No One Is Buying Up Shale Assets.html,"Since the start of the year, 57 oil production and oilfield services companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Many more bankruptcies are on the way, all in the shale patch. And there does not seem to be even a shred of light at the end of this tunnel. The U.S. shale patch was the pride and joy of the nation’s energy industry. Rightly called a shale revolution, the boom in oil and gas production fueled by hydraulic fracturing turned the United States into the world’s largest oil and gas producer. But this had a cost—a cost that is now being paid with a flurry of bankruptcies. Rystad Energy said last month it expected another 150 U.S. shale oil companies would file for Chapter 11 protection by the end of the year unless prices rise above $50 a barrel. Others have suggested we might see consolidation, the way the industry consolidates during every crisis, but this time around, that seems unlikely. When earlier this year, Chevron snapped up Noble Energy in a $5-billion deal, there was the usual talk that this could be the start of a wave of mergers and acquisitions for which the oil industry was ripe: assets were cheap, many asset owners were struggling, and those with the money could expand their asset base at bargain prices. Only it seems this time no one has the money. Reuters’ Jessica Resnick-Ault, Dmitry Zhdannikov and David Gaffen called it the legacy of the U.S. shale revolution in a recent analysis. Shale drillers grew too much too fast, failing to make any money on the way. After investors got burned not once but twice, few want their business.
 The last oil price crisis, the one that did spark a consolidation wave after 2014, was a typical one. Prices dropped, some companies failed, others were bought up by bigger ones, prices rebounded, and production growth was back on track. Investors, however, began to insist on returns instead of growth. Producers were trying to get there when this year’s crisis hit. It is no surprise that potential buyers are wary.  Related: OPEC Production Rises By 950,000 Bpd In August Debt is a major turn-off. Shale drillers took on debt the way squirrels store nuts for winter. Shale oil production is a capital-intensive business, but this aspect of it was for a long time overshadowed by the fact that oil starts flowing a lot more quickly from a fracked shale well than a conventional one. So drillers took on debt and boosted production to repay this debt. It became a vicious circle that the last crisis may have well put a stop to. Banks became reluctant to extend shale oil drillers’ credit lines even before the Saudis turned the taps on and Covid-19 spread across the world. New wells were not yielding as much as borrowers had said they would, and debt piles were growing. Then the pandemic came, and drillers started falling under the twin weight of billions in debt and $20 oil. 
 Again, these falls mean there is cheap acreage for sale, and some of it may well be excellent acreage. But there is one more reason in addition to general wariness why there are few buyers: the industry does not seem to believe that there will be a third shale revolution. The last crisis sparked a shift in priorities, Argus Media’s Tom Fowler reported recently. Growth at all costs is no longer priority number one. Smart growth is, which means sucking out every last barrel of oil from a well before buying more acreage to drill more wells. What is more, investors have not stopped insisting on getting higher returns rather than higher production, and companies have been listening. With a focus on fully developing their already existing assets and pressure from investors to boost returns, asset-buying appetite is very likely to remain low for a while. It could be a long while unless oil prices soar in the near future.",-0.8688,negative
Saudi Arabias Oil Exports To The US Slump To Lowest Level In Decades.html,"The world’s top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, continues to try to tighten the world’s most transparently reported oil market by slashing crude oil shipments to the United States to the lowest levels in decades. OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia is estimated to have sent to America just 177,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August, according to tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. To compare, the Saudis shipped as much as 1.3 million bpd to the United States in April, when they sent a fleet of supertankers to flood the U.S. market with oil during the price war with Russia at the end of March and early April. Back in April, the tanker fleet from Saudi Arabia coincided with the massive oil demand loss and threatened to overflow U.S. storage capacity.
 After Saudi Arabia and Russia forged a new pact to cut a record amount of OPEC+ production to support oil prices, the Saudis continue to signal they are intent on helping U.S. inventories shrink by withholding supply. U.S. imports of Saudi crude in August, with tankers that had likely departed Saudi Arabia in June and July, were estimated to be the lowest since 1985—at 264,000 bpd, according to data from commodity research firm ClipperData, reported by CNN Business. U.S. imports of Saudi crude oil in September are estimated to further plunge from August, by nearly half to around 140,000 bpd, ClipperData’s preliminary estimates show.
 The low volume of Saudi crude loaded in August on tankers en route to the U.S. suggests that U.S. imports of Saudi crude in statistics for September and October will continue to hover around the lowest in decades. Apart from keeping supply off the world’s most visible oil market, Saudi Arabia likely has a political motivation to slash shipments to the U.S., after President Donald Trump was unhappy with the Saudi price war in April that damaged U.S. producers, Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNN Business.  ",-0.9901,negative
Oil Price Rally Stalls As US Fuel Demand Falters.html,"Oil prices rallied after touching multi-decade lows in April, but they have been stuck in a narrow trade band for two months now as the pent-up U.S. demand rebound in June has fizzled out with flattening fuel consumption that continues to struggle to reach pre-pandemic levels.   Analysts and economists have already largely ruled out the idea of a V-shaped recovery in demand that could drive oil prices up.  WTI Crude prices have lingered in the low $40s since early July in an uncharacteristically low-volatility trade, especially compared to the wild swings in prices earlier this year.  Despite the massive oil production cuts from OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners to limit supply and the nicely-recovering demand in China, oil consumption in the world’s top petroleum consumer, the United States, is stuck at levels below normal.  COVID-19 related travel restrictions and continued consumer caution in some U.S. states after the resurgence of coronavirus infections have kept U.S. gasoline demand well below year-ago levels in the summer driving season. Gasoline demand had materially improved from the April lows until June, but after that it has been stuck at below 9 million bpd between end-June and mid-August, before rising to 9.161 million bpd in the week to August 21, EIA data shows.  Despite the rise in that week, demand is still off the 9.9-million-bpd seen during the same week last year, suggesting that this summer driving season will end without gasoline demand returning to pre-pandemic levels.   Related: Oil Prices Jump On Major Hurricane-Driven Crude Draw Crude oil inputs at U.S. refineries are still 15 percent lower than they were at this time last year, while refinery capacity utilization was 82.0 percent in the week to August 21 compared to 95.2 percent in same week of 2019, EIA data shows. 
 Marathon Petroleum’s CEO Mike Hennigan said on the Q2 conference call in early August that the refiner expects the current environment “to stay challenged for some time.”  “And we’re seeing a slow recovery, which is headed in the right direction, but we’re just anticipating that it could take a while to get back to normal,” Hennigan said.   “That last 10% to 15% of lost demand is going to be really hard to get back,” Noah Barrett, an energy analyst for Janus Henderson Investors, told The Wall Street Journal.  The flattening of the gasoline rebound curve doesn’t bode well for the pace of the economic recovery in the United States as fewer people than usual go out and about and spend money on products and services.  Granted, U.S. consumer spending rose by 1.9 percent in July, but uncertainty for August and the next months is high as the $600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits expired at the end of July.  “The expenditures needed to fuel the economy’s recovery in August are a big question mark given the hit to personal income nationwide with the loss of those $600 weekly unemployment benefit checks,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York, told Reuters last week. 
  Related: OPEC Production Rises By 950,000 Bpd In August In August, U.S. consumer confidence dipped for a second straight month, and to the lowest point in more than six years, data from The Conference Board showed.  “Consumer spending has rebounded in recent months but increasing concerns amongst consumers about the economic outlook and their financial well-being will likely cause spending to cool in the months ahead,” said Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.  More than 200 members of the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) expect a slow recovery from the recession, with almost half the respondents expecting inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) to remain below Q4 2019 levels until the second half of 2022 or later, according to the August 2020 NABE Economic Policy Survey. A total of 80 percent of panelists indicate there is at least a one-in-four chance of a double-dip recession.  Prospects of slower economic recovery have also weighed on oil prices as lower economic activity in the world’s biggest economy would also mean slower recovery in oil demand. The OPEC+ cuts have stabilized oil prices, but WTI Crude has been struggling for two months to break above the low $40s as fuel consumption recovery, including gasoline consumption and the still very weak jet fuel demand, has leveled off. ",-0.9952,negative
Russia Wants OPEC To React To Oil Demand Recovery.html,"Russia will propose to OPEC+ to react to the recovery in global oil demand, which has now reached 90 percent of the levels seen before the pandemic, Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday. ""We hope for speedy demand recovery and will propose to react to it under OPEC+ deal,"" Reuters quoted Novak as saying. Speaking at an online meeting to discuss Russia's oil and gas industry, Novak said, as quoted by the TASS news agency, that Moscow hopes there would be faster demand recovery, to which it would react within the OPEC+ pact.
 According to Russia's energy minister, global oil demand will return to pre-pandemic levels at some point in 2021. If it weren't for the OPEC+ deal – in which Russia is the largest non-OPEC contributor – oil prices would have been $10-20 a barrel, and at times even negative, Novak said, noting that the record production cuts stabilized the oil market and prices. As part of the OPEC+ deal, Russia's oil production will drop by 13.8 percent year-on-year between August and December 2020, Novak added. Russia's full-year oil production will be 10 percent lower in 2020 than it was in 2019, he said.
 In August, when OPEC+ started easing the record cuts by 2 million bpd, Russia's oil production rose by 5 percent from July, to reach 9.86 million bpd, according to Reuters' estimates of energy ministry data in tons. Russia's production figures include condensate, while the OPEC+ deal excludes it. Considering Russia's condensate production of around 700,000 bpd-800,000 bpd, and Russia's crude oil production ceiling of 9 million bpd as of August 1, the figures show that Russia produced slightly more crude oil than its quota, according to Reuters estimates. Pavel Zhdanov, Vice President for Finance at Russia's second-largest oil producer, Lukoil, told Reuters, ""Our experience with the previous OPEC+ deal and results of the last two months prove that stopped wells could be returned back to operation quickly without losing their productivity.""  ",-0.7924,negative
OPEC Production Rises By 950000 Bpd In August.html,"OPEC produced more oil in August than it did in July as the cartel continued to relax its production cuts, a Reuters survey has revealed, with recovering demand also stimulating more production. The August increase amounted to 950,000 bpd, the survey said, to a total of 24.27 million bpd. This appears to be despite Iraq’s pledge to cut an additional 400,000 bpd from its output in August to compensate for its undercompliance with the OEPC+ cuts. Nigeria had also pledged to effect additional production cuts to compensate for its overproduction since May.
 When OPEC+ extended the record production cuts of 9.7 million bpd by one month through the end of July, the coalition agreed that all countries in the pact should comply 100 percent with their quotas, and those who have not, should be compensating for lack of compliance by overachieving in the cuts in July, August, and September. Beginning in August, OPEC+ has reduced the cuts to 7.7 million bpd, of which OPEC’s 13 members need to cut a combined 4.868 million bpd, excluding Iraq’s and Nigeria’s compensatory cuts.
 Demand for oil may be improving and thus helping the cartel stick to its quotas, but even OPEC is not particularly optimistic for oil demand this year. In its latest Monthly Oil Market Report the group said it expected oil demand loss this year to hit 9.1 million bpd, a 100,000-bpd upward revision on its July forecast. OPEC also estimated that the global economy could shrink by as much as 4 percent this year, a revision from 3.7 percent estimated in July. Since June, when OPEC’s production hit the lowest since 1991, according to data surveyed by Reuters, output has rebounded by 2 million bpd, including 1 million bpd of production cuts that Saudi Arabia had implemented voluntarily to hasten the oil price rebound by tightening supply. In August, the Kingdom, which is OPEC’s largest producer by far, pumped 9 million bpd, up by 600,000 bpd from July.",-0.9457,negative
Kuwait Looks To Ease Dependence On Saudi Arabia With New Oil Development.html,"Kuwait had already slipped into an economic contraction of 1.1 per cent the fourth quarter of 2019, over the same period in the previous year, before Saudi Arabia decided to gamble again with the finances of fellow OPEC members and launch another oil price war in March designed to disable the U.S. shale oil sector. With the same destruction of its budget as happened the last time that it trusted Saudi Arabia’s decision-making, Kuwait is even more desperate for funds than last time, as is every other OPEC member that followed Saudi’s lead. In January – still two months ahead of Saudi’s latest disastrous decision - Finance Minister, Mariam Al-Aqeel, stated that the breakeven oil price required for Kuwait to post no deficit was US$81 per barrel (of Brent), and unveiled a 2020/21 budget projecting a KWD9.2 billion (US$30 billion) deficit. This was the sixth major deficit year in a row, and higher than the 2019/20 estimate of KWD8.27 billion, even after the transfer of 10 per cent of total revenue to the Future Generations Fund, managed by Kuwait Investment Authority. Al-Aqeel stressed at that point that the government was likely to have to continue to take from the state’s General Reserve Fund to finance the deficit because of the National Assembly’s ongoing refusal to approve the public debt law. This is despite, as Al-Aqeel underlined, borrowing (via increasing the public debt) is cheaper than withdrawing money from sovereign wealth funds. Regardless of this, though, with Kuwait deriving about 50 per cent of its GDP, more than 90 of its exports, and about 90 per cent of its fiscal receipts from hydrocarbon products, the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) last week agreed with the finance ministry to cut its budget from oil and gas production to KWD3 billion (US$9.9 billion) from KWD3.7 billion dinars, according to local reports. Given this, and recent and historical precedent, Kuwait certainly cannot trust Saudi Arabia to benefit it in any way financially, which is a key reason why the Emirate is looking to develop its own, independent revenue streams rather than rely on the whim of Saudi Arabia for revenues from the Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ). Although currently back in production, the PNZ has been perennially used as a weapon by Saudi to keep its neighbour in check, irrespective of the damage that this caused Kuwait. The recent re-starting of production from the jointly-held PNZ came five years after the Saudis closed it down, for the official reason that the site was not compliant with new environmental air emission standards issued by Saudi Arabia’s Presidency of Meteorology and Environment Authority (according to this agency, a gas leak had sprung in one of its 15 platforms). The real reason was that Saudi wanted to show its neighbour who was in charge, as Kuwait had been increasing its competition to Saudi Arabia in the key Asian export markets at that point to the degree that it was selling oil to buyers in Asia at the widest discount to the comparable Saudi grade for 10 years. Additionally, Kuwait had been increasing the difficulty for Saudi Arabian Chevron (SAC) in obtaining work permits to operate in the Zone, jeopardising SAC’s ability to move ahead with its full-field steam injection project in Wafra that was intended to boost output of heavy oil there by more than 80,000 bpd.  Related: Oil Prices Rise As U.S. Dollar Index Drops To 2-Year Low
 The recent focus of Kuwait, then, has been on projects that do not involve Saudi Arabia, with the additional major benefit that such non-Saudi-reliant revenue streams will allow it to properly leverage the international investment potential it accrued from its inclusion in 2018 to the benchmark FTSE Russell’s emerging-market indices. For some considerable time thereafter, the Boursa Kuwait enjoyed a period as the darling of Middle East-focused investors, with Kuwaiti stocks outperforming most of their Persian Gulf peers at that point. At around the same time, MSCI – the giant of all such benchmark indices – said that it might announce the upgrade of the nation to emerging market status in 2019, putting Kuwait in the front rank of Middle East investment prospects, alongside Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, and a move expected to generate billions of dollars of much-needed international investor inflows into the country.  Earlier this year, though, as a result primarily of the COVID-19 outbreak, MSCI put this new listing on hold until at the earliest November of this year. Nonetheless, as MSCI made clear that the postponement was only due to the COVID-19 pandemic – and that the Boursa Kuwait continues to meet all the necessary criteria for a classification in its emerging markets indices – Kuwait wants to ensure that there are no financial questionmarks hanging over it that may postpone the listing further. This MSCI action would enable Kuwait to broaden and deepen its capital markets, assuring would-be foreign investors of a more liquid capital markets base from which to operate and also affording Kuwait the opportunities to raise capital, not just through new share issues but also eventually through future sizable corporate and state bond offerings. This, in turn, would provide funding for Kuwait’s to achieve its cornerstone economic plan (‘Project Kuwait’) of increasing crude oil and condensate production to four million barrels per day (bpd), up from just 2.5 million bpd currently, and to significantly begin to diversify its economy away from dependence on hydrocarbons exports. In this vein, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) announced recently that it intends to issue tenders for the purchase of 24 rigs to support plans to expand its oil and gas output capacity. Although the KOC previously announced in September 2019 that it would order these 24 ‘HP750’, ‘HP550’ and ‘HP1000’ rigs, the tender was postponed for internal reasons, but with the financial crunch it now faces, Kuwait is moving forward with the key oil and gas projects that require the new hardware. In particular, export operations for the first shipment (500,000 barrels) of heavy crude for the global market began recently from South Ratqa, with the KOC’s chief executive officer, Imad Sultan, adding that the strategy is to secure production of at least 60,000 bpd of heavy oil from the South Ratqa field in Stage 1.
 This crude oil output is on the proviso that it is processed at the new Al-Zour refinery in order that it can contribute to the production of low-sulphur environmental fuel and supply it to power plants in Kuwait, as well as being available for export. “Also, this production will be added to the heavy oil that is currently being produced from the Umm Niqa field in northern Kuwait, which has been going since 2016, that amounts to 15,000 barrels of heavy oil per day, so totalling 75,000 barrels per day,” Sultan underlined. This feeds into last week’s statement from the KOC that it is moving forward with the parallel development of three new fields in the western region of Kuwait, namely ‘Umm Rass’, ‘Kara’a Al Marw’, and ‘Kabd’. Specifically, to begin with, the KOC has obtained approval to float a tender to build and operate two new Jurassic production units, which will enable Kuwait to reach free gas production capacity of 850 million cubic feet per day, and the production of approximately 250,000 bpd of light crude.",-0.8512,negative
Oil Prices Rise As US Dollar Index Drops To 2 Year Low.html,"Oil prices jumped on Tuesday morning, paring overnight losses ahead of the API inventory data report.At 09:02 AM, WTI was trading 1.60% up at $43.31, with Brent crude changing hands at $46.07, up 1.74% on the day.The broader rally in equity markets, expectations of yet another draw in crude oil stocks, and ongoing weakness in the U.S. dollar are fueling the rally in oil this morning. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, better known as DXY, has fallen precipitously after hitting a high in March. According to FxStreet, the DXY ‘’dropped to levels last seen in April 2018 in the 91.80/75 band, opening the door for the continuation of the downtrend in the short/medium-term horizon’’. 
 The dollar took another dive last week when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a new inflation target of 2 percent, making dollar-priced commodities cheaper for global buyers. Oil has started September on a positive note, but global demand concerns remain the number one risk. Yesterday, Oilprice.com reported that demand in China has driven the current rise in oil prices, but weaker crude imports could pour cold water on the rally, especially if the demand recovery in Europe and the U.S. fails to materialize in September.  The current rally in equities and the fragile recovery of the economy in the U.S. and the E.U. is largely driven by stimulus programs, and a whole lot of extra stimulus may be needed to keep entire industries from collapsing in the next couple of months.
 The next bullish catalyst for oil could come from the API, which is set to release its crude inventory data report later today.  Ahead of the release of U.S. stockpile data, analysts polled by Reuters expect U.S. crude stocks to have fallen by about 2 million barrels in the week to Aug. 28, while they expect gasoline inventories to fall by 3.6 million barrels, and distillate inventories are expected to drop by 1.5 million barrels.",-0.9919,negative
Iraq Struggles To Restart Damaged Refineries.html,"Still struggling to overcome the draining consequences of almost ceaseless conflict and political haggling, Iraq has nevertheless managed to overcome the worst of the 2020 oil market slump in its upstream sector. It demonstrated sufficient subtlety with its Kurdish exports and has more or less reined in its OPEC+ non-compliance antics, to avoid the ire of leading crude exporters. Yet as Baghdad and other Iraqi cities put up with the intense August heat when temperatures are routinely above 45 °C, Iraqi authorities have started to chart a pathway for the Arab nation’s downstream segment, too – albeit a bit too ambitious given the conditions of today’s Iraq; one might argue that staying realistic is the best Baghdad can do. Iraq’s only fully functional refinery is located in Shuaiba near the Basrah hub of crude production, where a 210kbpd refinery is serving the product needs of the south. Under normal circumstances, Shuaiba should have processed some 280kbpd, using a fourth refining unit, however the realities of being an oil-dependent war-torn Middle Eastern nation and the COVID pandemic have gotten in the way. Shuaiba has had its fair share of difficulties in the past years as the river water it relies on is becoming increasingly salinated and was forced to temporarily shut down refining because of that – might not seem that tragic in the COVID-19 era when demand for fuels has plummeted but definitely was a dangerous development before that given all the missing output from the Baiji Refinery.  While the Shuaiba Refinery caters for the products need of Iraq’s South and the 140kbpd Daura Refinery is feeding the exigencies of the burgeoning Baghdad market, the ill-fated Baiji Refinery (some 130km from Baghdad) was satisfying the needs of the nation’s heartland. Yet Baiji has suffered immensely on the back of plentiful military operations – first it was damaged by ISIS’ barbaric actions, only to take another hit when the Iraqi internal forces recaptured it in 2015. Last week the Iraqi oil ministry has set a deadline to the completion of the partially destroyed 310kbpd Baiji Refinery complex, one of the most badly damaged key infrastructure assets during the Islamic State sudden onslaught on Iraq.   Related: The Innovative Solution Bringing Electricity To Crisis Stricken Areas
 Nominally, Baiji consists of 3 different parts – Salahuddin 1 and 2 (both with a throughput capacity of 70kbpd) and the Northern Plant (throughput capacity of 170kbpd). As of today, only the Salahuddin 2 unit is working properly – Salahuddin 1 has had most of its reconstruction works completed on the hydrogen and gasoline units but is still yet to restart, with the Northern Plant requiring the most overhauling. The new Iraqi government claimed that it expects all Baiji repair works to be completed by 2023. The commercial rationale to maximize refinery output is more than evident – despite struggling with deficit-plagued budgets, Iraq spends some $2.5 billion per year on importing oil products. One can barely call the above mentioned developments a success – across the board downstream projects have run into financing problems and subsequent delays. Yet Iraqi authorities keep on surprising the general public by claims that the Middle Eastern nation would build 5 new greenfield refineries with a total refining capacity of 790kbpd. In late 2019 the Ministry of Oil has issued a list of the 5 given refineries – Kirkuk (70kbpd), Wasit (140kbpd), Nasiriyah (140kbpd), Basrah (140kbpd) and al-Faw (300kbpd). The peculiar choice of locations raises some evident questions – if the government remains intent on bringing the Shuaiba refinery back to full capacity, why would it seek two further refineries in the Basrah Governorate with an incremental capacity of 440kbpd (ie to a total of 840kbpd)?  Realistically speaking, the list of greenfield refineries to be built is more about the government signaling the extent of its wishes rather than determining specific goals for the upcoming years. Moreover, Iraq has another long-running downstream saga – that of the 140kbpd Karbala Refinery, basically the only greenfield refinery in the history of modern Iraq. According to the Oil Ministry, Karbala is 88 percent complete and would be fully ready for commissioning by 2023, the same year when repair works on its brownfield assets would be finalized. Karbala is located midway between Baghdad and Najaf, with the $6.4 billion construction overseen by a South Korean consortium headed by Hyundai. As usually with Iraqi refineries, Karbala’s 2023 commissioning deadline would be 5 years beyond the initially set deadline – understandable, given that it is predominantly financed by the ever-cash-strapped government. 
 On a separate note, the oil refineries of Iraqi Kurdistan form a separate microcosm – in contrast to the southern governorates Erbil lacks a downstream powerhouse. The 110kbpd Kalak Refinery might have been the flagship of the region’s refining activities yet it remains severely underutilized, at 20-30% on average. The only refinery in Kurdistan that operates more or less according to its technical possibilities is the 60kbpd Ninewa Refinery. The problem is that against the background of OPEC+ commitments and upstream investments plummeting in 2020 feeding the Kurdish refineries (the latest one of which was commissioned in July 2019, the 40kbpd Erbil Refinery) with substantial amounts of crude is a rather difficult affair.",-0.9837,negative
Robust Chinese Demand Fuels Oil Market Recovery.html,"Following last week's price rally, oil prices move higher on Monday morning, on bullish demand figures coming from China. Additionally, U.S. dollar weakness contributed to last week's price rally. Traders are also expecting deeper OPEC+ cuts of 1.15 million bbl/d in August and September. As a result, Brent crude traded above $46 which was mainly driven by the supply disruption triggered by the hurricanes in the Gulf Mexico, which affected around 84% of the USGC production where around 1.7 million bbl/d remain offline.   Laura, a category 4 hurricane made landfall early Thursday last week, in the Southwestern part of Louisiana. becoming one of the most powerful storms in history to hit the state. More than 310 offshore platforms, out of 643, were evacuated in addition to nine refineries leading to a 2.7 million bbl/d outage, around 15% of the US refining capacity. Furthermore, initial reports reveal that the damage caused to the refineries is minor, but continuing power outages could delay the resumption of refining operations. The impact of the supply disruption on the markets wasn't too large as fuel inventories continue to balloon. With the impact of the hurricane dissipating, BP is said to be preparing to inspect its facilities in the Gulf of Mexico in preparation to restart its operations.  On the other hand, the situation in India continues to affect the market sentiment as India reported around 79 thousand COVID-19 daily cases for three consecutive days. There has also been a rebound in the number of cases in France and the United Kingdom sparking concerns about the possibility of a new lockdown. 
 Chinese oil demand at record high  Prices continue to be supported by China’s affirmation of its commitment to the phase 1 trade deal with the United States. Chinese oil demand is said to have risen by 16.7% m/m to stand at 14.16 million bbl/d in July, which reflects the strength of its economic recovery. July’s demand figures are also higher than one year ago, reaching 12.83 million bbl/d. This is also 2.02 million bbl/d above our forecast for the month of July. Yet, China’s stockpile of oil and refined products, which grew significantly during the price downturn in Q2-2020, continues to be high, and are expected to draw down at a slow pace. The abovementioned factors are expected to cap the price rally during the month of September. Furthermore, India announced that it will halt oil product imports from China, which means that Chinese refiners may find it hard to find overseas buyers for their surplus output. Earlier this month, Indian refiners already stopped chartering Chinese-owned and Chinese-flagged tankers for oil and fuels as tensions between the two countries continue to rise as a result of the ongoing border dispute.    Related: Supermajors Still Struggling Despite Oil Price Recovery On the other hand, Chinese imports of U.S. crude oil hit a record high last month, and are likely to continue to rise in August and September as part of the U.S.-China trade talks. China  promised to purchase as much as $25.3 billion in value of U.S. energy products, and has currently only imported slightly above $3 billion. The United States is the 4th largest supplier of crude oil to China at 863 thousand bbl/d, after Saudi Arabia at 1.26 million bbl/d, Iraq at 1.36 million bbl/d, and Russia at 1.73 million bbl/d, data from July 2020 suggests. Last month, the U.S. exported 863 thousand bbl/d to China, about six times its June exports , which stood at just 143 thousand bbl/d. In total, China imported 12.08 million bbl/d in July. 
 Saudi Arabia has traditionally been the top exporter of crude oil to China. Yet, recent OPEC+ production cuts, lower compliance from Russia and Iraq, and Aramco price hikes, affected the Chinese choice of crude imports. Last May and June, Saudi crude oil exports to China reached 2.16 million bbl/d. However, Saudi Aramco has cut its oil deliveries to Asia by 10-30% while raising prices which led to a reduction of its market share.  US energy data remain bullish yet with cautious outlook  Bullish figures continue to emerge from the EIA, but the news failed to move markets. Last week, the EIA reported a decline in commercial crude oil inventories by 4.7 million barrels to stand at 507.8 million barrels combined with a decline in the SPR by 1.8 million barrels to stand 649.5 million barrels. Gasoline inventories also dropped by 4.6 million barrels to stand at 239.2 million barrels, while middle distillates rose by 1.4 million barrels to stand at 179.2 million barrels. U.S. net imports declined by 1.041 million bbl/d due to rising exports. Based on EIA figures, we estimate U.S. oil demand to stand at 17.265 million bbl/d, down by 0.815 million bbl/d w/w, considering net crude oil imports, which stand at 2.55 million bbl/d and refinery runs which stand 14.712 million bbl/d. The U.S. oil rig count reversed again, and fell by 3 to total 180 rigs, while oil production rose by 0.1 million bbl/d w/w to stand at 10.8 million bbl/d. ",-0.9778,negative
Angola Aims To Ramp Up Oil Production.html,"Angola, Africa’s second-largest oil producer after Nigeria, will need foreign and government investments to discover up to 57 billion barrels of crude oil by 2025, according to a new energy strategy reported by state news agency ANGOP.    Angola’s plan includes foreign investment of US$679 million as well as US$188 million investment by the Angolan state, the news agency said.   
 Angola’s new oil and gas strategy to boost production comes a week after the country’s upstream regulator ANPG issued its forecast for oil production from existing fields, which showed that after peaking in 2008 at nearly 2 million bpd, Angola’s oil production would average 1.28 million bpd in 2020, and continuously decline as oilfields mature, to just above 500,000 bpd by 2028, if no new discoveries are made.    OPEC producer Angola has suffered a steady production decline over the past decade, especially after the oil price crash of 2014, because older fields were maturing while prohibitive costs offshore Angola drove upstream investment away.  This year, just after Italy’s Eni started up the Agogo oilfield only nine months after its discovery, the pandemic and the oil price crash deferred exploration drilling everywhere, including in Angola.  Apart from Eni, France’s Total has also been active offshore Angola in recent years, planning to drill an ultra-deepwater well off the coast of Angola that will be the deepest in the world. The campaign, which began in January 2020, was estimated to last 240 days, said Maersk Drilling, whose drillship Maersk Voyager was set to drill the deepest well ever drilled offshore. 
 However, the pandemic halted drilling activities for several months.  Olivier Jouny, Managing Director of Total Exploration & Production Angola, told Africa Oil & Power last week that Maersk Voyager was due to restart drilling at the end of August.  “We are now ramping-up our activities offshore and will restart drilling wells, perform seismic acquisitions and non-routine production and maintenance operations on both Block 17 and 32,” Jouny said.  ",0.3167,positive
Oil Major Equinor Stops Drilling In US Shale Patch.html,"Norway's Equinor will not drill any more wells in the U.S. shale patch this year as it adjusts to a lower-for-longer oil price environment, a spokesperson for the company said as quoted by Hart Energy. The company stopped drilling in the Bakken and the Marcellus shale plays where it has acreage in March this year as it slashed billions in spending in response to the oil price collapse. Now, Equinor will also be cutting jobs in the shale patch, although it has yet to specify how many. On the silver lining side, however, the company has no asset sale plans, which means it could still have long-term plans for its shale oil and gas operations in the United States.
 ""There is no change in our acreage portfolio. The action that we are taking now is to ensure that our business is profitable in a lower price scenario,"" the spokesperson said. ""Equinor is in a strong financial position to handle market volatility and uncertainty,"" outgoing CEO Eldar Sætre said in March. ""Our strategy remains firm, and we are now taking actions to further strengthen our resilience in this situation with the spread of the corona virus and low commodity prices."" At the time, Equinor said it could be cash flow neutral at oil prices of $25 per barrel. Since March, prices first dipped and then recovered above that level, which must have benefited the company. In a lower-for-longer scenario, however, everyone is adjusting.
 Meanwhile, like the rest of the European majors, Equinor is pursuing its transition strategy from an oil company to a broader energy company. Early this year, before the pandemic hit, Equinor unveiled a plan to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy it produces by at least 50 percent by 2050. The firm also plans to grow its renewables business and become a global offshore wind major. Under the plan from February, Equinor targets to grow its renewable energy capacity tenfold by 2026, when it expects production capacity from renewable projects of 4 GW to 6 GW. ",0.8953,positive
Can Guyana Salvage Its Much Hyped Oil Boom.html,"The deeply impoverished South American country of Guyana in recent years was heralded as the hottest new oil boom in the Americas. A series of large offshore oil discoveries by integrated global energy major ExxonMobil catapulted Guyana into the spotlight. Earlier this year Exxon made its 16th oil discovery in the offshore Stabroek Block. The oil giant also revised upward its estimated recoverable resources in Guyana to more than 8 million barrels of oil equivalent, highlighting the country’s considerable hydrocarbon potential. There was further good news at the end of July 2020 with Hess, which is partnered with Exxon and CNOOC to develop the Stabroek Block, reporting that appraisal drilling of the Yellowtail well had identified two more reservoirs. The low breakeven costs associated with operating in Guyana’s offshore oil fields, with Hess estimating they are an industry-low $35 per barrel, coupled with the considerable exploration upside is attracting significant interest from energy majors around the globe.  Stabroek Block  Source: Hess. These factors underscore the tremendous potential held by the Stabroek Block and the considerable revenue it will generate for Guyana’s impoverished economy. While those elements point to a prosperous future for Guyana, bitterly disputed March 2020 elections and an ensuing political crisis indicate that the poverty-stricken former British colony may not be able to fully realize its petroleum wealth. A political impasse arose after the March elections with Guyana’s two major political parties claiming victory. The post-election dispute triggered a ballot recount, allegations of electoral fraud against both political parties, and numerous court cases. 
  Related: Investment Funds Could Miss Out On Multi-Year Bull Run In Oil & Gas Stocks The ongoing crisis amplified existing ethnic tensions worsening the political wrangling and battle for control of Guyana’s substantial oil wealth. The deepening political dilemma saw the U.S. impose sanctions comprised of visa restrictions for any citizens of Guyana Washington believed were undermining democracy. Earlier this month, Guyana’s opposition The People's Progressive Party was found to have won the bitterly contested election bringing an end to months of dispute which was crippling investment in the country’s burgeoning oil industry. The former British colony’s vast oil wealth has already transformed it into the world’s fastest-growing economy, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF predicts that Guyana’s gross domestic product will expand 53% this year alone and by another 6% in 2021. Key to maintaining this growth and the development of what is considered the second poorest country in South America is attracting the substantial foreign investment needed to develop Guyana’s vast oil wealth. The appointment of opposition leader Mohamed Irfaan Ali earlier this month as president has resolved, for the time being, the political impasse which existed since March. That is an important step to realizing Guyana’s vast oil wealth. Nonetheless, outgoing incumbent David Granger made it clear that he will keep contesting the election results, meaning that the current peace may be short-lived.  The exploitation of Guyana’s vast hydrocarbon wealth is further complicated by claims of irregularities in the contracting process with Exxon.  Considerable concerns were raised that the agreement, made by former President Granger’s government, was sealed on terms that are disadvantageous to deeply impoverished Guyana. Exxon, it is alleged, used rushed negotiating tactics with inexperienced Guyanan officials to obtain very favorable terms. According to analysis from industry consultant Open Oil, the Stabroek deal could cost Guyana up to $55 billion.   Related: Two Major Shale Drillers Plan Layoffs
 In response to the controversy, the newly appointed Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat initiated a review of Exxon’s 2016 Payara production sharing agreement. Exxon made the Payara oil discovery in 2016 and is in the process of developing the project’s 45 wells, which on completion will have the capacity to produce 220,000 barrels of crude daily. A key gripe expressed in local media is that the set 2% royalty rate is too low and significantly less than the royalties charged in other South American jurisdictions. The ministry has established a team of international experts including Former Alberta premier and Canadian Queen’s Counsel Alison Redford to review the development plans for the Payara asset. These latest developments are amplifying concerns that Exxon’s plans to develop its offshore oil assets in Guyana will be delayed. According to industry consultants Rystad Energy, if the 2023 start-up date of the Payara project is delayed by one year, around $1.5 billion in oil revenues for Guyana, Exxon, and the project partners will be lost. President Ali’s administration is also in the process of formulating a policy on local content requirements for foreign oil companies operating in Guyana. That could further complicate the government’s review of the Payara project and create an additional burden for Exxon. Any delays could seriously impact the projected growth of Guyana’s oil industry, revenues, and production. Earlier this year before the March elections and resultant political crisis, Rystad estimated Guyana’s production would reach 1.2 million barrels of crude daily by 2030, making it the third-largest producer in Latin America, generating around $30 billion of revenue annually. That would be transformative for one of the region’s poorest countries. There are fears that Latin American resource nationalism could be taking root in President Ali’s government as it moves to review existing contracts and push for more favorable terms. If oil nationalism emerges, it would be a significant deterrent for foreign energy majors, driving away the urgently required investment and technology needed to tap Guyana’s offshore oil resources. This would derail projected economic growth and development in the deeply impoverished former British colony.",0.8588,positive
Is Argentinas Shale Too Expensive To Drill.html,"It is one of the most abundant shale plays in the world, with oil reserves of up to 16 billion barrels and gas reserves of 308 trillion cubic meters—resources that could guarantee a country’s energy independence and turn it into a relevant international supplier of oil and gas. But only if the price is right. Vaca Muerta was Argentina’s hope for energy independence and even international success as an exporter of oil and gas. But that was before the oil price crash and before yet another financial crisis in the South American country that slowed energy investments. Nevertheless, Big Oil is not leaving Argentina, suggesting that there are still benefits to be reaped from a presence in the Dead Cow formation. Exxon was earlier this month granted an exploration license for a block in Vaca Muerta by the Neuquen provincial government. The news is important as the license comes amid an industry-wide shift from growth to retrenchment, with costs getting cut everywhere they can be cut, projects getting delayed—especially exploration projects—and capex plans getting radically revised. The license Exxon scored is a long-term one, for 35 years. As part of the deal, Exxon will drill and complete two wells over the next four years. If these yield positive results, the supermajor will then drill as many as 44 wells.
 It is too early to praise Exxon for not quitting on Vaca Muerta, but the new license is a positive sign for the long-term—if not the short-term—future of the shale play. Another supermajor who is betting on the long-term attractiveness of the Vaca Muerta is Shell. The Anglo-Dutch supermajor said recently that it would delay some projects in the play but would not be going away. “In the long term, Vaca Muerta has the ability to be competitive [internationally],” Shell Argentina president, Sean Rooney, told media earlier this month. “I am confident that we are seeing a delay of one to two years until we can resume new investments.” Related: Two Major Shale Drillers Plan Layoffs Vaca Muerta’s development, even before the latest colossal oil industry crash, was marred in various challenges. For one thing, production costs were too high because of the lack of infrastructure in place and the fact that things like frac sand and water had to be transported over long distances to reach the wells. For another, pro-business president Mauricio Macri’s reformist government lost the last election with another financial crisis rattling Argentina, dampening appetites for expansion in the Vaca Muerta, especially after the new government featured ex-president Christina Fernandes as vice-president, Oilprice.com’s Latin America correspondent Matthew Smith wrote recently. Fernandez led the nationalization of YPF in 2012 and now sparked worry among energy companies that the new government could again embark on an interventionist agenda despite assurances from the vice-president that this would not be the case, Smith noted. Despite all these problems, all is not lost. Production costs have been falling in the Vaca Muerta, so the improvement in oil prices we have seen since this spring’s lows would motivate some drilling. According to a Wood Mackenzie analyst, as long as Brent is above $30 a barrel, the most developed parts of the Vaca Muerta would again start making economic sense, Bloomberg reported in April. Brent is not trading above $40 a barrel, and while this may be too low for Middle Eastern producers, it is high enough for some Vaca Muerta projects.
 In addition to the favorable price development, President Alberto Fernandes has pledged to the energy industry to support it with new legislation safeguarding investments already made in the shale play. Some argue that these safeguards will not be enough to spur on more drilling, compromising not just Argentina’s entry into the international oil market but its energy independence, especially in gas. Others believe, based on supermajors’ continued presence in the play, the Dead Cow could become the next Permian, only with even lower production costs. Government estimates from a couple of years ago saw the Vaca Muerta boost national oil production to some 1 million bpd and gas production to 260 million bpd by 2023. State energy major YPF had plans to expand its LNG export capacity, although it had to drop these this year as the LNG glut weighed on prices. Shell has also had to revise its plans for boosting Vaca Muerta production to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily by 2021. Others have delayed growth plans as well. But none has exited the play yet. There are currently eight drilling crews in the Vaca Muerta, according to Argentine media. That is down from 36 in November last year. Of course, hardly anyone would have expected that the shale play would remain untouched by the latest storms in global oil and gas. And yet, Shell and Equinor partnered in January to buy a new block in the Vaca Muerta from Schlumberger. True, in January, no one had any idea about what was coming in March and April, but in Argentina, things were already difficult for oil and gas companies. That acquisition and now Exxon’s new license to drill suggest that despite the multiple challenges, the Dead Cow still has rich enough potential to compensate for those.",0.9953,positive
The Biggest Oil Discovery Of The Year Could Happen Here.html,,0.0,neutral
Can Perus Oil Industry Survive This Crisis.html,"Indigenous protests have taken over Peru, threatening to undermine the Latin American nation’s burgeoning upstream industry. To many it would come as a surprise that Peru has any substantial amounts of oil production, especially on the back of sizeable crude and product imports to the country growing higher and higher. Yet below the surface, Peru’s problems mirror those of many other Latin American countries – combining sustainable development in fragile biodiverse zones with hydrocarbon reserves that are still available in places that are either nature reserves or of spiritual importance to indigenous populaces. Peru has become a battlefield between economic interests and social rights – a battle zone stained by blood as to date at least 3 indigenous protesters were killed in skirmishes with the enforcement authorities. Latin America’s travails with the corona virus have triggered various responses from respective governments and Peru has been one of the most peculiar cases. Despite a swift lockdown announced on March 15, a week after Peru has reported its first case, Peru has been overwhelmed by the pandemic, having the second-highest COVID mortality rate globally after Belgium. As the Peruvian government introduced stringent health measures, production from faraway regions was shut down temporarily, in the hope that it can be restarted as soon as the COVID-19 gets more manageable. Technically Peru’s fields need not have shut down completely, however the national oil company PetroPeru has suspended all transportation on its 100kbpd Northern Crude pipeline that brings oil from the country’s northern states to the Pacific Ocean port of Bayovar. Peru’s total crude production has averaged 60kbpd before the COVID-induced market slump, dropping to half of that by June 2020. The Chinese national oil company CNPC remains the largest producer in Peru yet its assets, being located next to the Ecuadorian frontier, rarely make it to the front pages as they lie within reasonably well-documented oil plays. Yet it is in Peru’s jungle-covered state of Loreto which moved into the forefront of the nation’s oil industry. Following the corona-induced demand slump Petrotal has temporarily laid off all but essential personnel at the 40 MMbbls Bretaña field in early May, indicating that by August most curtailments would be eased, either fully or partially. When in the first days of August the Calgary-based company tried to restart the field, mayhem ensued.
 Within 24 hours of Bretaña’s restart the indigenous protestors took over a pumping station, forcing the producer to halt production. The conflict quickly escalated into complete chaos, both sides accusing the other of opening fire, what is beyond controversy, however, is the completely unnecessary death toll – 3 indigenous protesters from the Kukama community have been shot by security forces. Their allegations of the Peruvian government failing the COVID-19 pandemic and disregarding the environmental damage caused by oil production in the Amazon jungle have remained unanswered. Despite a lack of publicly articulated commitments, the government of Peru has managed to find common ground with the protesters and would restart the Northern Oil Pipeline by the end of August.  Related: Saudi Energy Ministry To Help Build $500 Billion Smart City Where does this leave Peru’s prospects for further drilling in the Amazon? In the specific case of Block 95 which hosts the Bretaña field, it seems that the authorities have persuaded/coaxed the indigenous protesters into a period of lull. The Bretaña cargoes are now finding their way to buyers (the 19 API and 0.5 sulphur grade is currently assessed at an approximately -1 per barrel discount to ICE Brent) and it seems that the indigenous peoples’ rights to live in an oil-free environment will be flung aside as all parties concerned want to maximize their revenues, now that the oil price is well above their production costs of ~25 per barrel. Moreover, if the case of neighboring Ecuador is to suggest anything, then Peru’s overall oil prospects would tilt heavily towards the economic side. Ecuador’s failed Yasuni-ITT initiative remains a poignant reminder that the dilemmas Latin American nations have been facing so far wielded very little progress on the environmentalists’ side. In 2007 then-President of Ecuador Rafael Correa has called on the international community to garner $3.6 billion in payments, in return of which Quito would perpetually suspend all oil development activities in the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) National Reserve in the Amazon, Ecuador’s most oil-prolific new frontier which coincidentally turned out to be one of the most biodiverse corners of our planet. Were the initiative to work, it could ensure that indigenous peoples would not be confronted with the risk of oil spills and deforestation for industrial purposes – the plan’s only weakness lied in its reliance on international investors caring about the environment to such an extent as to financially back the ambitious initiative.
 The Yasuni-ITT trust fund was open for almost 3 years and eventually collected less than 5% of the required sum. This in turn has prompted Ecuadorian authorities to start looking at their oil reserves in the Amazon and starting from 2016, the ITT national park has started witnessing drilling. Needless to say, cases of oil spills (such as the one this April when a landslide has damaged an oil-transporting pipeline and crude started to pour into the Coca river, a source of drinking water for indigenous communities. The Ecuadorian failure to keep the environment out of harm’s way and to safeguard the interests of its own people who happened to live in the wrong place will loom large in upcoming legal battles, of which Peru will not be the last. Hence, the resolution of the current political impasse in Peru is doubly important – it can either confirm a negative trend of disregard or mark a first-ever Latin American victory of social rights over economic development when it comes to oil.                 ",-0.9882,negative
Africas Largest Energy Project Faces A Major Terrorist Threat.html,"Back in 2010, Texas-based Anadarko Corp. (now a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp.) and Italian energy giant ENI SpA announced the discovery of approximately 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, equivalent to ~29 billion barrels of oil, in Mozambique's supergiant offshore basin of Rovuma, immediately catapulting the south African nation to a potential global LNG superpower.  As expected, there was a stampede of oil and gas majors, including ExxonMobil, Total, Shell, and CNPC (China National Petroleum Corp.), who rushed in to stake their claims.   But now there's a real danger that the biggest investment splurge in Africa could go up in smoke even before it gets properly started thanks to the proliferation of terrorism in the region. Mozambique could potentially reap nearly $100 billion in LNG revenues, or 7x its annual GDP, over the next 25 years, and boost real growth rate from 4% to between 4.8% and 5.4% (depending on the scenario) thus highlighting the sheer transformative power the project could have on the poverty-stricken nation.  But failure of the LNG projects to take off could deal a severe blow to Mozambique, the world's 6th poorest nation, as well as President Nyusi's government, which is desperate to attract foreign investment. Growing Insurgency A notorious terrorist organization that has aligned itself to the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks especially in the Cabo Delgado province.  Over the past three years, the insurgency has killed more than 1,500 people and displaced another 250,000 in the country's north, and no one even knows who they really are, what they want or where their loyalties lie, with the government keen to simply refer to them as a band of criminals. Locals call them ""al-Shabaab"", according to the Atlantic Council, but their official name--as far as we know--is al Sunna wa Jummah (ASWJ). The group's leadership is unknown.   Related: OPEC+ Complied 95% With Oil Production Cuts In July When they behead someone, there is no message--no demand. It is also unclear whether they have any real connection to the Islamic State, or whether such a connection is still metamorphosing.  The root causes, as always, are underdevelopment and corruption.  It has been about eight months since Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi was sworn in for a second term at the top seat. In his acceptance speech, Nyusi emphasized the importance of peace if the nation is to realize its full potential. Mozambique was plagued by a 16-year civil war that ended in 1992, yet resurgent armed conflict remains a major challenge to this day. 
 The president also vowed not to fall victim to the African curse where resource-rich nations tend to fare even worse economically than their less endowed peers. Easier said than done. The previous government has a rather checkered history in terms of maintaining peace, but billions of dollars of natural gas are now on the line.  Last year, the Mozambican government approved the Rovuma LNG Development Plan, which is headed by oil majors ExxonMobil and ENI.  The initial development phase could see the companies pony up more than $60 billion in capex with Mozambique potentially becoming a chief LNG supplier to China after the Asian country launched Blue Sky Defence Action Plan designed to curb air pollution.   Related: Bank Of America: Brent Will Recover To $60 In H1 2021 However, it goes without saying that for this to become a reality, Nyusi will need to guarantee security to all the companies investing in a region where Islamic State-linked insurgents have lately intensified attacks against security forces and civilians. The government will be charged with the task of not only halting the attacks but also addressing the key drivers of the insurgency, including unemployment, poverty, and a general lack of economic opportunities.  That is looking to be a tall order, considering opposition hard-liners have continued with the killings despite Nyusi signing a peace accord with Renamo, the main opposition party, last year that brought a hiatus to the years-long conflict. Corruption and Hidden Debt Next, Nyusi will need to address the endemic corruption in the public sector to increase accountability and ensure that gas revenues do not end up in some government official's offshore account.  Just a year into his first term, Nyusi's government was thrown into a tailspin after international donors and the IMF froze monetary aid to the country after discovering that the government had failed to declare $1.2 billion in loans. The fallout hit a new low when the United States charged the former finance minister with money laundering with three Credit Suisse bankers also implicated. 
 No less than six fraud-related cases are still pending at the courts and Nyusi will have to  ensure this sort of thing never happens again under his watch if he wants to win over long-term investors and goodwill by the international community. Total and ENI To Carry On Although Nyusi's government has tried to put on a brave face and insists it can deal with the menace single-handedly, the persistent and disruptive attacks prove otherwise.  But maybe Mozambique's neighbors will come to the rescue. A couple of days ago, Nyusi took over the reins of power as the chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) from H.E. Dr John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, President of the United Republic of Tanzania. The 16-nation regional trading bloc pledged to help Mozambique combat terrorism within its borders.  Thankfully, Total and ENI have indicated that they intend to carry on in the midst of the violence and might, hopefully, still be able to deliver within their deadlines. Total says in its website that the Mozambique LNG project is on track for delivery by 2024 though ExxonMobil is yet to make a final investment decision. Nyusi will be keen to leave a legacy as the president who brought Mozambique from the bottom rungs of the UN development index to a middle-income nation, and the whole world is now watching because nearly 30 billion barrels are at stake.  Ultimately, despite the formidable challenges, Mozambique's LNG resources could spawn one of the continent's rare rags-to-riches stories. The economics are particularly appealing, with the country's low production costs a boon in this era of low energy prices. ",-0.9852,negative
Low Prices Put The Brakes On Perus Oil Ambitions.html,"One country often ignored when considering Latin America’s regional hydrocarbon sector is the Latin American country of Peru. Over the last two decades, the Andean country has developed rapidly to become one of the leading mining jurisdictions in Latin America. In only 20 years, Peru’s vast mineral wealth combined with it becoming an attractive jurisdiction for foreign investment caused gross domestic product to soar fourfold to $227 billion for 2019. The successful growth of the Andean country’s mining industry could be one of the reasons that Peru’s oil wealth was ignored. Sharply weaker oil prices are certainly another factor.  There are growing signs that the Andean country is ready to realize its oil potential, particularly as Lima seeks to bolster economic growth and recover from the harsh impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF believes the Andean country’s GDP will contract by a very worrying 13.9% during 2020. Key to recovering from such a savage economic downturn, which could be the worst ever recorded, sees Lima looking to tap into Peru’s considerable hydrocarbon potential and revive the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. For some time, Peru’s petroleum potential has been ignored by the global energy majors with other Latin American jurisdictions such as Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina gaining the lion’s share of attention. This is despite the Andean country possessing 18 sedimentary basins with hydrocarbon potential of over 88 million hectares. These include four main proven producing basins; the sub-Andean onshore Marañon, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios basins as well as the offshore Tumbes basin. Peru Oil Basins  Source: PeruPetro. At the start of 2020 Peru’s Ministry of Energy and Mines stated that the Andean country had proven and probable oil reserves of 3.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 33% weighted to crude and natural gas liquids at the end of 2018. That sees Peru ranked sixth for proven and probable oil reserves in Latin America behind Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, and Argentina.
 There is every indication that if investment, as well as upstream exploration and development activities, can be ramped-up those oil reserves will grow. Peru’s Ministry of Energy and Mines estimated in 2018 that the Andean country had 1.8 billion barrels of contingent oil resources and a further 29 billion barrels of prospective resources.  Related: Big Oil’s Petrochemical Bet Is A Risky One The Ministry of Energy and Mines recently released a resolution aimed at promoting investment in oil exploration and production. The legislation is aimed at providing clearer guidelines, clarity, and greater predictability for all parties involved in upstream oil and natural gas activities in Peru. It is intended for this to stimulate further foreign direct investment in Peru’s hydrocarbon sector. During 2019 Peru received foreign direct investment inflows of $8.9 billion with mining energy being among the largest recipients, although the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development expects this to halve for 2020.  The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, which at the end of July 2020 was one of the top-10 countries globally for cases and deaths, will sharply impact investment inflows and petroleum operations. In response to the pandemic, Lima implemented a strict quarantine causing Peru’s petroleum industry to shutter by early May 2020 and eventually restart operations during mid-July. That had a sharp impact on Peru’s oil production which had been steadily climbing over the last decade to hit an average daily high of 363,693 barrels during 2019. By the end of April 2020, the Andean country’s daily average hydrocarbon output had plunged 14% compared to a year earlier to 313,725 barrels and will fall further because of the impact of the pandemic lockdown and ongoing civil unrest. While higher-value oil production has fallen sharply since 2010, to average 53,000 barrels daily during 2019, natural gas output has been steadily climbing, reaching 223,993 barrels of oil equivalent for that year.   Source data: PeruPetro.
 Growing natural gas production resulted from Lima investing heavily in Peru’s natural gas infrastructure and positioning the fossil fuel as an answer to the Andean country’s energy needs.  Related: Saudi Oil Minister: Oil Demand Could See A 97% Recovery By The End Of 2020 Community blockades and protests, notably in the Amazon, are impacting Peru’s petroleum production. Upstream oil producer PetroTal earlier this month was forced to shutter operations at its Bretaña field in the Northern Marañon basin because of civil unrest as protestors attempted to overtake that facility. In March 2020, Frontera declared force majeure at long-troubled Block 192 in the Marañon basin because protestors cut the electricity supply to its operations. The loss of those two operations alone has shaved around 20,000 barrels daily from Peru’s oil production. Unrest in Peru’s northern Amazon is growing, fanned by the COVID-19 pandemic and community concerns over a lack of access to resources and environmental damage caused by the extraction of petroleum. This, along with significantly lower oil prices will impede Lima’s plans to expand oil exploration and production. The central government is feeling considerable economic pressure, not only because of the harsh impact of the COVID-19 pandemic but also because of dwindling energy exports. That makes Peru a net hydrocarbon importer, placing pressure on an already fragile economy, highlighting why Lima needs to boost petroleum and natural gas production. Ongoing unrest and community opposition to oil operations, notably in Peru’s Amazon area sees global oil majors taking a wait and see approach. This is being amplified by sharply weaker oil prices with many upstream oil explorers and producers reluctant to invest in higher-risk jurisdictions.",0.9055,positive
The Oil Industrys Biggest Weakness Is Its Reliance On China.html,"Whenever the commodity cycle reaches a trough, all eyes turn to China. Asia’s biggest powerhouse has through years of explosive growth become the top—or one of the top—importers of many commodities, leading the producers of these commodities to base their own growth strategies on China’s insatiable appetite. Nowhere is this truer than in oil and gas. And now the pandemic has bared the shaky foundation of this dependence. It could hardly be argued that China is an important factor in the oil markets. It is the second-largest consumer of crude oil—most of which it imports—and the second-largest LNG importer in the world. This has turned the country into a natural focus of growth strategies in the oil and gas industry. Every oil demand forecast and every gas demand forecast inevitably has China specifically—and Asia more generally—as the drivers of future growth. The pandemic has not changed this. Asia, and China in particular, are still seen as drivers of future oil and gas demand growth. The problem is, this growth will not be as robust as analysts forecast before the crisis. What is more, this growth will be delayed, potentially wreaking havoc with companies’ near-term plans. China gobbled up millions of barrels of oil when prices fell in March and continued to fall through May. One could say with a decent degree of certainty that if it was not for China, prices would have slumped a lot lower. In that, the country shined as what some have called “the Asian tooth fairy”. But even this tooth fairy’s storage space is finite and as global storage filled up with unsold—and unsellable—crude, so did China’s, raising questions about how long it could continue to soak up the world’s excess crude.
 China’s crude oil imports over the first half of the year rose by some 10 percent from the sale period of 2019. The latest data suggests they have continued to be robust in July, even as they slipped 3 percent from June. On top of that, reports emerged that Chinese state oil companies had booked tankers for at least 20 million barrels of U.S. oil this month and next.  Related: Big Oil’s Petrochemical Bet Is A Risky OneSo far, so good. But there is always a but. In July, Bloomberg reported that China had started selling crude oil from its storage. Now, this piece of information had the potential to shake up global markets like nothing else. China, the default buyer of the world’s oil, was now selling it, after having bought it on the cheap in the spring. While the selling can hardly be called the beginning of a trend, it did represent an unforeseen event in an industry already rocked by unforeseen events this year. China is not obligated to keep buying oil at this pace forever. If it suits it, China could take advantage of the higher prices and sell this oil, in competition with the rest of the sellers. There is a congestion of oil tankers at the moment in Chinese ports. For weeks now, according to a Wall Street Journal report, tankers have been piling up at the ports, waiting to unload in what in some cases are already full storage tanks. According to brokers that the WSJ cited, the pileup is made up of at least 80 tankers, more than half of the Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), each with a capacity to ship 2 million barrels of crude. The world’s top crude oil importer seems to have nowhere to put the oil it ordered earlier this year in hopes that demand for fuel would increase quickly. “The swift increase in imports in recent months is an optimistic sign for the global economy. However, the pace has been so quick that it has challenged the logistical capabilities of Chinese ports,” said OilX analysts earlier this month in comments on early Chinese oil import data.  Related: Saudi Oil Minister: Oil Demand Could See A 97% Recovery By The End Of 2020
 Indeed, demand for oil in China rebounded quickly to about 90 percent of its pre-crisis level, but then things began to slow down, as people remained reluctant to spend amid still heightened uncertainty about the future. Although not as vital as it is for the U.S., consumer spending is an essential indicator of any economy’s recovery, so that reluctance to spend was counted towards the downward risks for oil demand. Then there is the already present fuel glut in Asia, caused by none other than Chinese refineries. Higher oil import quotas, low oil prices, and strong pre-crisis demand led to this glut, and it came back to bite its makers with falling margins and, most recently, a wave of refinery shutdowns across Asia as demand continued to stall. On the positive news front, there are expectations that an ambitious infrastructure spending program devised by Beijing to jumpstart the economy will push up demand for at least diesel to a record high this year. Will that be enough to keep Chinese oil imports as strong as they were during the second half of the year? We have yet to see. So, one of the many unpleasant truths about the modern world that the coronavirus has bared is the oil industry’s dangerously strong reliance on a single source of demand growth. Effectively, oil exporters have gotten used to putting most of their eggs in the Asian basket, and this has backfired. In all fairness, oil demand has been devastated across the world, not just in Asia. Yet the hit from Asia—and specifically China—has been particularly painful.",-0.9751,negative
Is US Shale Poised For A Comeback.html,"It’s been a brutal year for shale. While the sector was already faltering, spurring countless headlines about the death of shale over the past year or so, the novel coronavirus has dealt the sector what many see as its death blow. As the bottom fell out of oil demand, compounded by a spat between the OPEC+ members of Russia and Saudi Arabia resulting in a global oil glut, the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark bore the brunt of the fallout, plunging to nearly 40 dollars below zero on April 20. The impact has been devastating for the U.S. shale sector as companies fall like dominoes across the Permian Basin and Texas oil towns dry up and blow away as their economies have ground to a halt seemingly overnight. The shale patch’s woes have been redoubled as key players like Halliburton and other major oilfield services companies flee the Permian and leave the shale sector for dead.  But it’s not all doom and gloom. Last week, amidst the tide of headlines elaborating shale’s demise, the World Politics Review published a refreshingly optimistic article entitled “Why U.S. Shale Gas Could Emerge From the Pandemic Stronger Than Ever.” The article does not skirt around the issues, referencing an “industry under siege,” “insufficient returns” and souring investors, and the plummeting production of shale and associated natural gas. 
 But while this “all appears to add up to an existential crisis for America’s natural gas producers and exporters,” argues the World Politics Review piece, “the current difficult market conditions are likely to be short-lived. In the medium to long term, global demand for natural gas is projected to grow. As demand picks up, so will gas prices, especially in markets without sufficient domestic supply.” The article repeatedly references Henry Hub prices, the key U.S. benchmark for natural gas, which have already increased from their low point earlier this year. “After bottoming out at around $1.50 per million British thermal units in June, Henry Hub prices have now recovered to around $2.30—about the same level as in August, 2019.” This is a great start, but it’s just not enough to make a significant difference for large scale U.S. shale outfits that need a more meteoric rise in prices to rebound from the pummeling the sector has taken this year. And the good news is that these Henry Hub prices are projected to increase even more, “while prices in overseas markets like Asia and Europe are likely to rebound even faster, restoring a healthier spread between American and foreign prices and allowing both gas producers and LNG exporters in the U.S. to profit. Meanwhile, American consumers and businesses will continue to enjoy much lower prices than those in overseas markets.” In the short term, the worst is far from over for the shale sector. Even with a tidal wave of bankruptcies already come and gone, the field is still overcrowded. What’s more, the business model that the grand majority of these companies is based on is indisputably unsustainable. “A reckoning was inevitable; it has only been accelerated—not caused—by the pandemic.” But even this, says World Politics Review, is a good thing. Think of it as natural selection--only the strongest, most resourceful, and most resilient companies will survive. This is not necessarily a fringe belief either, Oilprice reported on similar projections for a bigger better post-corona shale back in March. Of course, the massive consolidation we will likely see in the coming months is a double-edged sword that may make for a lopsided market going forward.
 But for those companies that are able to survive this low point, there is a significant amount of light at the end of the tunnel. “Over the next two decades, gas demand is projected to expand, mostly in emerging markets,” writes the Review. This projection, however, was published in September 2019, which might as well be a decade ago for all that’s changed in the past 6 months. The world is moving quicker than ever toward a green energy transition as the world of fossil fuels goes up in flames. Peak oil, many believe, is just around the corner. The future of U.S. shale, to a large degree, depends on how well it can insert itself into a greener future. ",0.9902,positive
Is It Time To Buy Canadian Oil Stocks.html,"Canadian exploration and production companies have not rebounded from the sharp sell-off that took place in the oil patch after the OPEC+ fallout in March and the almost simultaneous advent of the coronavirus. Immediately oil prices began to crater, dragging down oil equities in lock-step with them.  In April, when the Saudis and the Russians announced an agreement to cut production, oil prices bottomed and began to rebound. At the same time, it seemed that the coronavirus would not be as deadly as some had initially feared, giving oil futures a secondary boost. Production cuts by U.S. producers also helped to shore up prices from late-April. Then, as prices rose, U.S. production began to fall off a cliff.  EIA Drilling Productivity Report Although they remain depressed year over year, U.S. companies have seen a sharp rebound in share prices generally with large independent shale drillers, like Parsley Energy, (NYSE:PE) and Range Resource, (NYSE:RRC), tripling or quadrupling in value from March lows. While they may still have further to run as oil prices rise, gains like we’ve seen over the past couple of months are not likely. In this article we will take a look at several key Canadian Exploration and Production (E&P’s) companies to look for investment opportunities in the Canadian North. It is fairly short and sweet. It is no secret, as shown in the EIA numbers graphed above, that U.S. production is falling off a cliff. I discussed this earlier this month in an OilPrice article where I detailed why U.S. production was going to falter and decline. Essentially, new drilling at all-time lows is not sufficient to outpace the decline rate of older wells. This means there is going to be a big gap between supply and demand, assuming the global economic recovery continues. It is happening now, and will become more evident as the year rolls on. Oil is going to be in demand, at the very time we will be needing it most. Enter Canada. Just above our border with good access to takeaway pipelines is plenty of the oil our refiners in the East, and on the Gulf Coast need for blending. 
 Some key points about Canadian E&P companies.  Rystad This brings me to another, and final point here. Drilling is picking up in Canada! Baker Hughes noted a 7-rig increase Week over Week. That speaks volumes by itself. Baytex Energy-(NYSE:BTE) In a rising price environment these guys might just become a dollar stock again. On the good side they have a steady source of cash flow from their Marathon joint venture in the Eagle Ford, (MRO), and refinanced a big chunk of their massive debt just in time before Covid-19 hit, so there are no near-term maturities that could tank them. On the downside, they have long term debt of over $2 bn, which dwarfs their capitalization, and will eventually have to be repaid. I like BTE for growth. At their current price of $0.58 per share, down from $1.51 in February, they represent a largely derisked play. One point worth mentioning is at their current price they are in violation of NYSE rules about minimum share prices. If they don’t rebound within a specified time period, they are subject to delisting on this exchange.  Related: China’s Oil Buying Spree May Be Coming To An End Whitecap is a diversified player with toe in all forms of oil and gas E&P in Western Alberta province and Saskatchewan. Their production is skewed slightly toward oil. With proved reserves of ~500 mm BOE the company's 2-P reserves value would give it a gross valuation of $12.5 bn US. On an EV/2-P multiple of 6, Whitecap looks cheap at its current price. Analysts are high on the company as well. From my perspective the stock has run up 25% in a week, I don't see a rush to jump at current levels, and would wait for a pullback.
 A quick review of the analyst call for Q-2 left me impressed. No near term debt maturities, paid down nearly $2 bn of debt in the past two-years. Liquidity of $2.4 bn. Its capital program is funded from cash flow. 65% of current liquids production +/- 120K BOEPD, is hedged at $48 USD. What's not to like? With netbacks near $18, CPG is outperforming many of its peers. With AFF of $109 mm for the quarter, the company presents a P/CF of 5, fairly low, and suggesting its $1.98 U.S. share price isn't over-valued. But, as with Whitecap, it’s up 25% in a week. I'd wait for a pullback. PEYTO is gassy with stacked plays in some areas, with only about 20% of its reserves in liquids. Stating the obvious, this gives them a similar horizon scenario to the Permian, as shown below. PEYTO sees opportunity in sending gas south to the U.S., and the recent upward bump in gas prices supports that notion. Particularly as they own and operate a midstream entity. They are also looking east to LNG Canada for export. I've discussed that project previously. I have had my doubts about it, but haven't checked recently.  Source With cash flow from operations at a run rate of ~$150 mm we come up with P/CF multiple of <1 for this producer. Debt is a bit of hickey for PEYTO having had to reduce their credit line from $1.3 bn to $0.95 bn, with about $750 mm already drawn. Cash burn of $180 mm annually in capex, plus SG&A could create trouble in a year or two.  I think the thesis is sound for Canadian E&P companies. U.S. production is dropping, and they are ready to supply without the cash constraints with which American shale producers are saddled. All the companies listed have enough liquidity to survive the next few quarters, to time for the increased prices to put cash in their coffers. To make money we sometimes have to look beyond our borders and take note of the macro-environment affecting markets. If you are comfortable investing in microcap securities, like the ones mentioned, I think the market is moving in a direction that will show favor on them.",0.9843,positive
Is This The End Of Chinas Oil Buying Spree.html,"China’s record-breaking crude oil imports supported oil prices through the late spring and summer when oil demand recovery in the rest of the world had just started and then wobbled amid concerns of a second COVID-19 wave. But can the oil industry continue to rely on this support? China imported record volumes of crude oil in May and June, as the oil-hungry nation attempted to benefit from the low oil prices in April. The imports in July, however, were lower than in June. Still,  they were 25 percent higher than in July last year.  But China’s feast on low oil prices may now be over.  This month, China will import what could be the last of the bargain cargoes that refiners had snapped up in April. After August, however, it is anyone’s guess what will happen with Chinese crude oil imports.  On the one hand, factors that would support relatively high Chinese crude oil imports through the rest of the year include evidence that China’s fuel demand seems to have rebounded nicely and signs that China will increase its purchases of U.S. crude oil in an attempt to fulfill its promise laid out in the Phase 1 trade deal.  On the other hand, factors that could slow China’s crude oil imports over the next few months include higher oil prices compared to April lows, and weak fuel demand and refining margins in the rest of Asia, which could discourage Chinese refiners from exporting a lot of fuel to the region. 
 Then there is always the big unknown with China’s commercial and strategic reserves. Since China does not report inventories, analysts are only guessing how much crude oil China is stashing away in its strategic and commercial reserves.  Related:  According to estimates from Reuters columnist Clyde Russell, based on calculations of Chinese imports plus domestic production, less refinery throughput, China likely sent 1.92 million barrels per day (bpd) into its reserves in July. This was much lower than the estimated reserve fill in June of 2.77 million bpd, but close to the average for the January-July period reserve stockpiling of 1.95 million bpd, Russell estimates.   Going forward, it is unclear how much oil China would import—and consequently stash—as many different factors could tip the scales either way.  Among the factors that could continue to support relatively high Chinese crude oil imports, and thus support oil prices, is the recovering industrial activity, incentivized by government stimulus for infrastructure projects. Analysts believe that industrial activity and increased road freight and e-commerce deliveries are set to push up China’s diesel demand to a record high this year.  In another bullish factor for Chinese imports, and potentially oil prices, China is reportedly ramping up purchases of U.S. energy products, including crude, as part of the U.S.-China trade deal. Oil traders from the U.S. and importers from China told Reuters earlier this month that China’s state oil giants had tentatively booked tankers for plans to buy at least 20 million barrels of American in August and September. 
 Considering that China is estimated to have fulfilled just 5 percent of the targeted purchases of American energy products in the first half of 2020, increased purchases, including of U.S. crude, in the second half of the year could keep Chinese crude oil imports at relatively high levels.  Yet, there are bearish factors at play that could dampen Chinese appetite for crude imports for the rest of the year, possibly weighing on oil prices, too. Those include weaker fuel demand recovery in the rest of Asia, which weighs on the refining margins in the region. This could discourage China’s refiners from continuing to process record volumes of crude oil.    In July, China’s refinery production hit a record high of 14.03 million bpd, official data reported by Reuters showed after major refineries returned online from maintenance.   Yet, with weak margins and fuel demand in the rest of Asia, refiners may not have much incentive to process record amounts of crude oil if there is no market in Asia to absorb all those refined products.  China’s record crude imports have been supporting oil prices in recent months. Now analysts and the market are wondering if Chinese purchases could continue to do so in the coming months. ",-0.996,negative
Demand For Oil Tankers Plunges As OPEC Restricts Exports.html,"Ton-mile demand, a proxy for demand for oil tankers, has slumped in the summer as OPEC’s oil production dropped to a three-decade low and exports were drastically cut as part of the OPEC+ deal, according to a Lloyd’s List Intelligence analysis. Ton-mile demand – measuring the crude oil volumes carried by distance traveled – dropped by 18.6 percent year over year in July. The plunge in crude tanker demand in July was the steepest fall since the coronavirus started to impact global oil markets, Michelle Wiese Bockmann writes in the analysis. The drop was mostly due to the plunge in demand for tankers in the Middle East, whose key producers and members of OPEC are cutting production and exports in response to the crash in global oil demand. Early data from Lloyd’s List Intelligence suggests that demand for tankers will be equally depressed in August.
 The ton-mile demand data also suggests that in June and July, non-OPEC exporters gained market share in terms of tanker demand at the expense of OPEC, according to Lloyd’s List. For August, demand for tankers in Saudi Arabia at least is not expected to jump, although OPEC+ began easing the record collective cut by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) on August 1. Saudi Arabia has said it would not be rushing into ramping up crude oil exports this month, as the increased production will go to domestic power generation, for which Saudi Arabia burns more oil during the summer months.
 In the brief Saudi-Russian price war in March and early April, supertanker owners were the winners, as the spat coincided with the start of the lockdowns in major economies and increased the global oil glut. Shipping companies had a field day with Saudi Aramco booking tankers en masse to flood the market with oil, while traders scrambled to charter tankers for floating storage to sell at higher prices later. According to Teekay Tankers, crude tanker spot rates are likely to be weaker in the second half of 2020, as more vessels will be returning to the trading fleet from floating storage.   ",-0.9748,negative
Oil Prices Rebound On EIA Inventory Report.html,"A crude oil inventory draw of 1.6 million barrels sent oil prices higher today, with the Energy Information Administration also reporting a fall in gasoline inventories and a modest build in distillate fuel inventories. This compared with a draw of 4.5 million barrels for the previous week, the third weekly draw—and hefty—in a row. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute cooled oil bulls’ optimism by estimating a gasoline inventory build of close to 5 million barrels for the week to August 14.
 The EIA, for its part, estimated gasoline stockpiles had shed 3.3 million barrels last week, versus a modest decline of 700,000 barrels. Gasoline production last week fell, to 9.4 million bpd from 9.6 million bpd a week earlier. Distillate fuel inventories rose by 200,000 barrels in the week to August 14, after a 2.3-million-barrel draw estimated for the previous week. Distillate fuel production averaged 4.7 million bpd, versus 4.8 million bpd for the previous week. Refinery runs fell to 14.5 million bpd last week from 14.7 million bpd the week before.
 Brent crude traded at $44.89 a barrel at the time of writing, with West Texas Intermediate at $42.44 a barrel in what is shaping up to be a mixed-results week.

UAEs Oil Major ADNOC Sees Robust Return Of Oil Demand.html,"The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) sees a robust return of oil demand, mainly from China, ADNOC Group’s chief executive Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber told IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin in a recent interview. The oil market has visibly tightened over the past two months as economies started to reopen, said Al Jaber, who is also the UAE’s Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology. “The approach of OPEC and its leadership also helped build confidence in the markets. And as a result, we are seeing a robust return of oil demand. This is mainly coming from China. Having said that, our industry will have to remain cautious and nimble,” ADNOC’s top executive said.
 The oil and gas industry, however, needs to be “cautiously optimistic” about the structural macroeconomic changes and has to continue focusing on cost management, Al Jaber told IHS Markit. ADNOC produces most of the oil in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is currently OPEC’s third-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia and Iraq.   Earlier this month, Amin Nasser, the chief executive of the world’s biggest oil-producing and oil-exporting company, state oil giant Saudi Aramco, said he was optimistic about the pace of oil demand recovery in Asia.
 “We are seeing a partial recovery in the energy market as countries around the world take steps to ease restrictions and reboot their economies,” Nasser said in a statement following Aramco’s Q2 report this month. Speaking about the UAE’s competitive advantage on the global oil market going forward, ADNOC chief executive Al Jaber told IHS Markit that the key was low-cost production in combination with low carbon emissions. “The world is going to need oil and gas for some considerable time to come. It is up to us as oil and gas producers to deliver that energy as responsibly and as sustainably as possible,” Al Jaber told IHS Markit’s Yergin. ",0.9545,positive
South America Is Rapidly Becoming A Global Leader In Offshore Oil.html,"South America has made a cost-cutting leap since 2013, when it was the world’s most expensive region for deepwater oil and gas production costs. Average operational expenditure (opex) per barrel of oil equivalent has more than halved since then, from roughly $26 to $12.7 in 2020, a Rystad Energy report shows. The region also enjoyed the largest cost decline globally this year, in both absolute and percentage terms. South America’s deepwater opex is driven mainly by Brazil, which accounted for roughly 99% of the continent’s brownfield costs from 2013 to 2020. Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras alone accounted for nearly 88% of South America’s deepwater opex. It therefore makes sense to focus the cost reductions on Brazil to get the greatest impact. One of the factors that have helped Brazil save opex is Petrobras switching out its floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) fleet. When the state player initially began production on pre-salt basins it chose to rent most of its fleet, which led to a surge in its operational costs. In 2015–2016 the company started ordering more owned FPSOs. Our numbers show that Petrobras increased its fleet of owned FPSOs by 16 whilst reducing the number of leased FPSOs by six from 2013 to 2020. Eight out of 10 fields in Brazil with start-up years from 2018 to 2020 have been developed via owned FPSOs while the two remaining fields use leased units, confirming the country’s shift from leased to owned vessels.
 Spurred by the current Covid-19 market volatility and turmoil in the energy industry, Petrobras has also cut its employee count by roughly 22% this year by way of buyout programs. The company plans to achieve total cost cuts of around $2 billion in 2020 by lowering its overhead and relinquishing unnecessary office space.  Another important driver for the reduction in opex in South America is a 55.2% drop in the value of the Brazilian real (BRL) against the US dollar (USD) exchange rate since 2013. This has reduced opex per barrel as the costs are incurred in BRL but paid in USD. The depreciation in the real has therefore helped offset local price inflation pressures for general goods and services. Petrobras has also increased its oil and gas production from 2013 to 2020, which has driven the opex per barrel down further thanks to economies of scale. Looking at this from a global and more generic perspective, already producing fields are generally more likely to have lower opex.
 In addition to the factors mentioned above, the portfolio of producing fields in South America has been getting younger – and newer fields require much less maintenance than mature fields that generally have higher operational costs. More than 110 mature fields have been abandoned on the continent over the past eight years, with new fields now accounting for over half of the total production in South America compared to 17% from very mature fields. In general, the production share from fields that have passed half of their lifetime has decreased drastically in South America since 2013. It will be interesting to see the cost profiles of Brazil and Petrobras when decommissioning of older fields starts in a few years, given the country’s lack of experience in this area. “Looking towards the future, we expect deepwater opex per barrel to stay relatively flat through 2020 to 2021. However, after 2021 we see lifting costs per production increasing by roughly $4 per boe, staying at that level through 2024 with an increase of approximately $1 in 2025,“ says Rystad Energy’s Vice President Energy Service Research Matthew Fitzsimmons. The Covid-19 inflicted uncertainty means that service companies, operators and investors will continue to watch their budgets and stay clear of any non-profitable or high-risk projects in the months and years ahead. Due to the generally low and turbulent Brent spot price this year, investments and projects that do not meet the cost and risk criteria set forth by the companies are likely to be delayed. Attaining the lowest possible cost per production will therefore be more vital than ever, despite the fact that cost reductions like the ones seen in 2014–2016 are unlikely as many of the possibilities have already been exhausted. Cost reduction strategies adopted by South America, and more specifically Brazil, could serve as a roadmap for other struggling regions and countries.",0.8196,positive
Petrobras Launches Development Of Major Deepwater Oil Field.html,"Brazil’s state oil major Petrobras has launched a new phase in the development of the first deepwater oil project since the start of the crisis, at the Mero field in the Santos Basin. According to a report by BNAmericas, the Brazilian major had commissioned a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel for the field from MISC Berhad, a subsidiary of Malaysia’s Petronas, with a capacity of 180,000 bpd of crude oil and 12 cubic meters of natural gas daily. The Marechal Duque de Caxias FPSO will be the third platform to be deployed at the Mero field, which is part of the prolific presalt zone of Brazil that holds most of its untapped oil and gas wealth.
 The oil price collapse put an end to many development projects, but the Mero field has pretty low production costs, at $35 a barrel, according to BNAmericas, which makes it commercially viable even at current oil prices. The field is currently producing some 26,000 bpd, as of June. This will be boosted with eight more wells that will feed oil and gas to the Marechal Duque de Caxias FPSO beginning in 2024. Demand for Brazilian crude seems to be strong: last month, Petrobras also launched a tender for another three FPSOs, to be deployed at the Buzios field—another deepwater monster in the presalt zone—with plans to boost production from the field to as much as 2 million bpd. These are long-term plans, however. The 2-million-bpd production rate should be reached by 2030, making Buzios the largest producing field in Petrobras’s portfolio.
 Petrobras also aims to make better use of the associated natural gas in its prolific oil-rich pre-salt area by having offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) units to process the gas, whose production has been rising with growing oil output in the area.  ",0.9723,positive
Is This The Beginning Of The End Of Oil Gas Exploration.html,"Booms and bust cycles are very much a part of investing in the fossil fuel sector. In previous energy downturns, prices frequently experienced serious slumps, but oil and gas companies mostly kept faith in their biggest asset: Oil and gas reserves buried deep in the ground. But things are markedly different this time around.  Faced with pandemic-driven demand destruction and a relentless call for climate-conscious and ethical investing, oil executives are resigning themselves to the uncomfortable fact that a significant amount of their vast oil and gas reserves will end up totally worthless. So much so, that's it may hardly be worth it to entertain new exploration at this point. And ""discovery"" news these days doesn't tempt investors like it once did.  You know things have truly gone to the dogs when the likes of BP Plc.(NYSE:BP)-- a company that doubled down on its aggressive drilling right after the historic 2015 UN Climate Change Agreement--finally gave in saying ""..concerns about carbon emissions and climate change mean that it is increasingly unlikely that the world's reserves of oil will ever be exhausted."" BP has announced one of the largest asset writedowns of any oil major this year after slashing up to $17.5 billion off the value of its assets and conceded that it ""expects the pandemic to hasten the shift away from fossil fuels."" BP owns a series of high-risk prospects including deepwater discoveries off Brazil, Angola and in the Gulf of Mexico. Its Sunrise deposit jointly owned with Canada's Husky Energy Inc., has an abundant supply of bitumen estimated at 3.7 billion barrels but requiring a complicated extraction process.  Related: Bank Of America: Brent Will Recover To $60 In H1 2021 On the opposite end of the spectrum, 'arrogant' ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has resisted writing down any shale assets this year, remaining adamant that oil and gas values will eventually  recover.
 However, the decision of whether or not to declare their prized gems worthless might soon be taken out of Big Oil's hands. 2025: D-Day for Stranded Assets The Paris Climate Agreement set to limit global warming to no more than below 2 degrees by the turn of the century if our planet is to avoid catastrophic and irreversible climate change. But here's the alarming news: Our current trajectory shows that we are heading for a 3.2 degrees temperature rise by 2100, which gives us a tiny 10-year window to severely curtail our greenhouse gas emissions or forever face the consequences of our folly. Unfortunately, precious little has been achieved since the ratification of the Paris Agreement in 2016. Last year's UN climate summit (COP25) in Madrid was a dismal failure with no new goals set despite hosting delegates from nearly 200 countries. However, companies like Exxon that continue to value their oil and gas assets based on 'business as usual' government policies could be whistling past the graveyard. This is the case because these companies are working on the assumption that governments will not take any ""forceful action"" in a bid to combat climate change.   Related: Shale Executives Make Millions As Their Company Goes Bankrupt Yet, this view might be wishful thinking. Back in January, Andrew Grant, senior analyst at Carbon Tracker, had warned that  new regulations regarding climate change are likely to be ""forceful, abrupt, and disorderly"" with decisive policy response likely to be seen from 2025 that will ""seriously hit the fossil-fuel industry.""  
 Companies at the biggest risk Grant's warning appears to have aged well, with the global oil and gas sector expected to write off a staggering $300 billion in stranded assets in the current year alone, and nearly a trillion over the next few years if governments begin to get aggressive with global climate goals. All eyes will be on the next UN Climate summit (COP26) set to be held in Glasgow, which will hopefully achieve much more than its predecessor. Bearing this in mind, companies that have aggressively written off their stranded assets such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A), Hess Corp.(NYSE:HES), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) could be safer long-term picks than others like Exxon that are still stubbornly clinging to their potentially worthless assets. Indeed, even long-suffering OXY is finally beginning to get some Wall Street love with JPMorgan recently upgrading the stock ""given the magnitude of underperformance, the de-risking of the maturity wall and the recent stability in the oil price."" Thankfully, even Exxon might slowly be coming to its senses after its recent decision to devalue its massive Kearl Lake mine north of Fort McMurray and ditch its debt-fueled US$30 billion-a-year plan to rebuild its aging worldwide portfolio. America's Big Oil is likely to be safe in the medium-term if Trump is re-elected, but could be in for interesting times if his chief Democrat adversary with his $5 trillion climate plan trounces him in the November elections.

Oil Prices Rebound As US Inventories Dwindle.html,"Traders remain concerned about the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world including the United States, India and Brazil. The rise in infections continues to have a negative impact on global oil demand in August. Last week, India had reported its fifth consecutive y/y decline in oil consumption with July’s figures showing a 11.7% y/y decline in refined product consumption. This includes a decline in diesel and gasoline consumption by 19.3% and 10.3% y/y, respectively, leading to Indian refineries to operate below their capacity in the financial year 2020-21. OPEC, IEA and EIA lower their demand forecast  OPEC and the IEA slashed their oil demand outlook in 2020 by 0.1 million bbl/d and 0.14 million bbl/d, respectively last week. Both reports which predicted a decline in crude demand by 9.1 million bbl/d and 8.1 million bbl/d, respectively weighed on positive sentiment, and kept oil prices in check.  OPEC now forecasts global oil demand to reach 90.6 million bbl/d, only 0.38 million bbl/d above our forecast, while the IEA forecasts global oil demand to be 91.9 million bbl/d in 2020. The IEA also sees oil demand standing at 93.8 million bbl/d in Q3 and 96.7 million bbl/d in Q4 which is slightly higher than CMarkits’ forecast of 92.33 million bbl/d and 94.33 million bbl/d in Q3 and Q4, respectively.  The weakest recovery continues to be in the jet fuel demand with July figures showing the number of aviation travelled kilometres 67% below pre-crisis levels. That may translate into a total jet fuel demand of 4.8 million bbl/d in 2020 which is 39% below the 2019 level, according to the IEA.   Related: Investors Are Looking To China To Find The Next Tesla
 Furthermore, the EIA STEO released last week forecasts that global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels will average 93.1 million bbl/d in 2020, down 8.1 million bbl/d y/y. This includes an expected average demand of 93.4 million bbl/d in July, which is a bit higher than our forecast of 90 million bbl/d. The US oil demand in Q2 is expected to have averaged 16.2 million bbl/d closely matching our forecast of 16.14 million bbl/d. Furthermore, the EIA lowered its US production forecast by 0.37 million bbl/d to an average production of 11.3 million bbl/d that is 0.4 million bbl/d below our previously published forecast.  On the other hand, last week’s prices were supported by the EIA report which showed that commercial crude inventories continued to shrink, with a drop of 4.5 million barrels w/w to stand at 514.1 million barrels. This was also combined by a decline in gasoline and distillates inventories by 0.7 million barrels and 2.3 million barrels, respectively. U.S. oil production saw a major weekly drop of 0.3 million bbl/d, and the decline in rig count also continued as Baker Hughes reported that the total number of oil rigs fell by 4 for to stand at 172, a number that could be set to fall even lower. In terms of demand, U.S. demand reached 19.37 million bbl/d, the highest number since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis last March. Our forecast for US crude oil demand stands at 18.79 million bbl/d in Q3 and 19.19 million bbl/d in Q4, supported by encouraging EIA data. Compliance a key issue for upcoming OPEC+ JMMC  According to Platts, OPEC-10 achieved a total compliance of 94% in July. Iraq’s production in July stood at 3.77 million bbl/d, up by 0.07 million b/d m/m, leading to a compliance of 83%, down by 7% m/m. On the other hand, Angola met its commitment with production of 1.17 million bbl/d in July achieving a 103% compliance compared with production of 1.22 million bbl/d in June with an 89% compliance. Nigeria’s compliance also improved by 5% as its production declined by 0.02 million bbl/d m/m to stand at 1.56 million bbl/d in July.  For the non-OPEC countries, compliance has been much better compared with the OPEC-10 with compliance in July standing at 99% compared with 94% compliance from the OPEC-10 leading to a total compliance of 96% for the OPEC+ in the month of July. The decline in compliance from the non-OPEC group is attributed to rising production in Russia, which increased output by 0.09 million bbl/d m/m leading to a compliance of 96% in July compared with 100% in June.   Related: Why Fracking Activity Hasn’t Increased As Oil Prices Recovered
 Nigeria is currently seeking exemption of its ultra-light Agbami crude to be considered as a condensate by IOCs, an issue that is not new for OPEC. In 2017, Nigeria had sought exemption of its Agbami crude when it had to stick to a production limit of 1.8 million bbl/d, reporting almost 450 thousand bbl/d of condensates, according to national figures, significantly higher than external estimates of 200-250 thousand bbl/d.  In 1989, OPEC defined crude with an API higher than 50 as condensates. Yet, it is often hard to track condensate production and distinguish them from crude oil, as condensates can be blended with crude oil. Condensates are a mixture of light hydrocarbons, composed of NGLs and naphtha with an API of 45 to 120. It is naturally separated from natural gas upon production when its temperature and pressure decline to atmospheric conditions. Condensates are normally priced lower than crude oil as they contain more LPGs and light naphtha, yet some condensates are priced higher than crude oil itself because they contain up to 40% jet fuel and diesel with lower yields of residual fuels.  According to Equinor, Agbami is classified as an ultra-light low-sulphur crude with an API density of 47.9, unlike Akpo, with an API of 46, which is classified as condensate by Total. Production of the Agbami crude ranges between 160 thousand bbl/d and 250 thousand bbl/d, and the majority of it is exported to China, India, Australia, Spain, Netherlands, and Brazil.  If OPEC exempts Nigeria’s Agbami crude, as the case with Russia, then around 160 thousand bbl/d of production will be removed from Nigeria’s official production number, leading to a rise in compliance to 103% from just 65% in July. Other African producers namely Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon continue to produce well above their production targets, which continues to affect the group’s total compliance rate, an issue that we expect to be on the agenda of the next JMMC. ",-0.99,negative
OPEC Complied 95 With Oil Production Cuts In July.html,"The OPEC+ coalition saw its compliance rate with the oil production cuts at 95 percent in July, four sources from the group told Reuters on Monday, which is a level similar to the previous month, if the additional one-month voluntary cuts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait for June are excluded. The 95-percent compliance rate for July has yet to be ratified by the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of the OPEC+ group, which is meeting later on Monday. The volatile oil market and the highly uncertain trajectory of global demand recovery has forced the OPEC+ group to have the JTC and Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) hold meetings every month until the end of 2020, instead of ahead of every full OPEC+ meeting only.
 The JTC and the JMMC are meeting this week, but they will not be discussing any revisions of the ongoing production cut pact and are not expected to make any major decisions to tweak the deal, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last week. At last month’s panel meetings in mid-July, the JMMC noted an improved compliance rate with the cuts. The overall compliance rate for the OPEC+ group was a record-breaking 107 percent in June, but it was due to the additional voluntary contributions from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, which cut a total of 1 million bpd in June on top of their shares of the cuts. Without those three voluntary outperformers, the OPEC+ group’s compliance was 95 percent in June, which still was the highest since the cuts started in January 2017. In July, OPEC’s production rose by 980,000 bpd month over month to average 23.17 million bpd, the cartel said last week. Of note in the group’s July production is OPEC’s secondary sources estimate that oil production in Iraq – the biggest laggard in compliance which has promised to cut much more to offset poor compliance – saw its production rise by 39,000 bpd to average 3.752 million bpd.     
 The leader of the non-OPEC group in OPEC+, Russia, said earlier this month that its oil output in July was in line with its OPEC+ commitment. ",-0.5175,negative
US Oil Drillers Look To Restart Shut In Production This Year.html,"Most US onshore operators will restore nearly all shut-in oil volumes by the end of the third quarter, with only a handful maintaining some level of curtailment for the rest of the year, a Rystad Energy analysis of 25 public oil operators’ second-quarter earnings statements shows. Curtailments from the 25 companies peaked in May with a net 772,500 barrels per day (gross – including royalties to the government - 965,600 bpd) taken off the market. Total cuts decreased to a net 680,300 bpd in June. In July, only about 306,500 bpd in net volumes (383,100 bpd gross) remained curtailed. This number is expected to fall to a net 74,300 bpd (92,900 bpd gross) in August, with nearly all production set to be reactivated by September and just a small amount remaining offline. The cuts monitored in the sample group were implemented mostly in April and May, and were entirely driven by economic and technical considerations, with operators shutting in lower margin wells while reducing flowback on others. A recovery in oil prices in the second half of May and a stronger overall market outlook prompted many producers to re-evaluate their shut-in plans. As a result, the actual total cut in May for several operators was lower than earlier guided, and June curtailments decreased month-on-month. Nearly all operators said they did not face any issues in bringing volumes back online as per schedule, as they had already worked on issues such as maintaining reservoir pressure and well integrity even before they began moderating output or shutting in wells.  EOG Resources highlighted that reactivation led to flush production before wells returned to standard profiles, which resulted in better-than-expected overall performance from these wells. Instances of flush production are already reflected in June well production data.
 The 25 operators cut output by a net 228,700 bpd in April and further deepened those reductions by 543,800 bpd in May. This followed an unprecedented collapse in oil prices to negative territory on 20 April, and a sharp decline in demand with governments around the world mandating lockdowns to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. When prices started to improve in June, only a few deepened their cuts, with some – including ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Noble Energy – sticking to their original plan, while many others started to restore volumes. ConocoPhillips prefers voluntary curtailments over hedging as a tool in dealing with price volatility, allowing it to retain complete exposure to a recovering market. The operator takes decisions on curtailments month-by-month, but thus far plans to bring back full production by the end of 3Q20. Chevron’s curtailed volumes are at the lower end of guidance, with production set to be restored in August as oil prices improve. Most of Noble Energy’s cuts were back online by the end of July. All other operators cumulatively restored 182,430 bpd in June, which, given the deeper cuts from three companies mentioned above, amounted to net gain of 92,180 bpd in overall production for June, thus erasing around 12% of the cuts made in May. The pace of reactivation has accelerated since July. Our analysis shows that as much as 373,800 bpd of net production, or 48% of the cuts made in May, was restored in July, followed by an additional net volume of 232,200 bpd slated to be back in August. Only a handful of operators intend to wait until September to reactivate the last of their curtailed volumes. One such player, EOG Resources, has elected to retain around 25,000 bpd of cuts until September, but the company noted curtailed volumes are being restored faster than originally anticipated. Nearly all reactivated wells have exhibited a degree of flush production, due to a buildup of bottom hole pressure, before returning to their previous profile – a well-understood trend that was initially expected by the producer. That surge helped EOG beat its second-quarter production guidance. Apart from EOG and ConocoPhillips, Oasis and Matador also expect to keep about 15% of curtailed production offline until September.
 Although the vast majority of US operators intend to fully reactivate curtailments in 3Q20, a select few aim to keep a percentage of volumes offline for the time being. Pioneer Natural Resources, which cut 7,000 bpd of production in 2Q20 from wells with higher operating costs, intends to only bring online about 1,000 bpd. The company said some volumes may never come back, and a lot will depend on the cash flow outlook of each well. Apache, having curtailed 7,500 bpd in May, said it has the option to reactivate wells when it thinks the time is right but anticipates that about 4,500 bpd may not return to production in 2020. PDC Energy also plans to keep a small volume offline beyond the end of the third quarter – we estimate about 2,000 bpd out of the 24,000 bpd cut in May. “No loss of production has been reported by any operator following the shut-ins and moderation of output, with most companies flagging a smooth return of operations, and in some cases posting a positive production impact from those reactivations,“ says Rystad Energy’s Vice President for North American Shale and Upstream, Veronika Akulinitseva.

Big Oil Wrote Down 87 Billion In Assets In Less Than One Year.html,"Seven of the largest oil companies in the world have written down a collective US$87 billion from the value of their oil and gas assets over the past nine months, as commodity prices slumped in the pandemic, an analysis by climate finance think-tank Carbon Tracker quoted by the Guardian showed. In the past three months alone, the companies Chevron, Shell, BP, Total, Repsol, Eni, and Equinor wrote down a total of US$55 billion off the value of their assets, the analysis showed. Many of those companies posted losses for the second quarter when global oil demand crashed by 20 percent due to the lockdowns in the pandemic. With the notable exception of U.S. supermajor Exxon, all five Big Oil recalibrated the value of their oil and gas assets in the second quarter due to the crash in oil prices and expectations of depressed demand for at least several more quarters. Shell booked an impairment charge of US$16.8 billion post-tax as it revised its price assumptions and market fundamentals. Total booked US$8.1 billion impairments – of which US$7 billion in Canada’s oil sands – as it cut its short-term price expectations. 
 “Total has now recognised that some of its oil and gas assets cannot be produced as the world decarbonises, a belated but welcome development for those worried about risks to both the environment and their investments,” Andrew Grant, Carbon Tracker’s Head of Oil, Gas and Mining, said, commenting on Total’s write down.  Related: Lithium-Ion Battery Production Set To Quadruple This Decade Chevron also booked impairments – at a total of US$5 billion, including US$1.8 billion, mostly associated with downward revisions to its commodity price outlook; it also reported its worst quarterly results in three decades.   BP also booked impairments, halved its dividend, and pledged to reduce its oil and gas production by 40 percent by 2030 as part of its strategy to reinvent itself from an International Oil Company (IOC) to an Integrated Energy Company (IEC).  Carbon Tracker’s Grant commented on BP’s announcement:
 “BP has radically changed the game. In the arms race of emissions announcements, most oil and gas peers have conveniently ignored the global need to produce and use less oil and gas – BP’s production cut of 40% by 2030 makes them unquestionably the industry leader.” Carbon Tracker sees the U.S. supermajors as laggards in announcements referring to emissions and the energy transition, while Norway’s Equinor may have too high long-term oil price outlook at $80 a barrel Brent, which it has not changed since the pandemic-driven crisis, Grant told The Guardian.  ",-0.7351,negative
President Trump Unveils Historic Israel UAE Peace Plan.html,"President Trump just announced a ""historic"" deal that will see Israel and the UAE open full diplomatic relations and Israel suspend its annexation plans in the West Bank. The shock announcement Thursday marks perhaps the biggest diplomatic development out of the Middle East in decades, after the regime change war against Assad in Syria had for years reportedly brought Saudi-led gulf countries of the GCC into quiet, covert cooperation with Israel.  Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump hailed the ""historic day"" in tweets confirming full normalization of diplomatic relations between prior enemies that had always lacked official recognition. Trump helped to broker the agreement, which also crucially involves Israel agreeing to halt its hugely controversial plans of annexing sections of the West Bank that included the sprawling Jordan Valley. HUGE breakthrough today! Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates! Though it's still anything but clear whether Israel will abide by this, Reuters writes of the breaking news that: Under the agreement, Israel has agreed to suspend applying sovereignty to areas of the West Bank that it has been discussing annexing, senior White House officials told Reuters.  Related: Lithium-Ion Battery Production Set To Quadruple This Decade  This is a major breakthrough for Israel, as Axios notes that the nation does not have diplomatic recognition in many Middle Eastern countries but has been steadily improving relations in the Gulf, largely due to mutual antipathy toward Iran.
 The Trump administration announced the deal is being called the “Abraham Accord,” with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner saying “Muslims will be welcome in Israel.” White House officials confirmed, Reuters writes, that ""senior adviser Jared Kushner, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz were deeply involved in negotiating the deal, as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien."" A joint statement issued by the three nations said the three leaders had ""agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates."" [emphasis ours] President Donald J. Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab Emirates spoke today and agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region. All three countries face many common challenges and will mutually benefit from today's historic achievement. Delegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign bilateral agreements regarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit. Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East's most dynamic societies and advanced economies will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations. As a result of this diplomatic breakthrough and at the request of President Trump with the support of the United Arab Emirates, Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the President's Vision for Peace and focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world. The United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates are confident that additional diplomatic breakthroughs with other nations are possible, and will work together to achieve this goal.
 The United Arab Emirates and Israel will immediately expand and accelerate cooperation regarding the treatment of and the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus. Working together, these efforts will help save Muslim, Jewish, and Christian lives throughout the region. This normalization of relations and peaceful diplomacy will bring together two of America's most reliable and capable regional partners. Israel and the United Arab Emirates will join with the United States to launch a Strategic Agenda for the Middle East to expand diplomatic, trade, and security cooperation. Along with the United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates share a similar outlook regarding the threats and opportunities in the region, as well as a shared commitment to promoting stability through diplomatic engagement, increased economic integration, and closer security coordination Today's agreement will lead to better lives for the peoples of the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and the region. The United States and Israel recall with gratitude the appearance of the United Arab Emirates at the White House reception held on January 28, 2020, at which President Trump presented his Vision for Peace, and express their appreciation for United Arab Emirates' related supportive statements.

Low Quality Crude Is Crushing Venezuelan Oil Exports.html,"Venezuela’s oil exports – which have dropped significantly over the past year because of the U.S. sanctions – are suffering another blow these days: the quality of the crude loaded on tankers is so poor that loadings are being delayed, Reuters reported on Thursday, quoting internal documents of state-owned oil firm PDVSA. The delays at PDVSA’s main export terminal are due to excessive amount of water in the tanks, as well as other impurities and metals, which has made tankers stop loading crude oil several times. The slow loading process due to the poor quality of the crude is yet another blow to Venezuela’s oil exports, which have plunged to their lowest levels in 80 years in the past two months.
 Venezuelan exports of crude and oil products combined were 388,100 barrels per day (bpd) in July, flat compared to June, Reuters reported last week, citing internal PDVSA data and estimates from Refinitiv Eikon. Venezuela’s oil production and exports have been in freefall for several years, but the U.S. sanctions on its industry and exports, the crash in demand, and the pandemic further accelerated the decline. Venezuela’s oil industry was collapsing even before the oil price crash and the pandemic, due to the increasingly stricter sanctions in the U.S. maximum pressure campaign against Nicolas Maduro’s regime and its sources of revenues. Oil income is pretty much the only hard currency that Maduro gets, so the U.S. is looking to stifle as much of Venezuela’s oil trade as possible. 
 In addition, PDVSA is severely cash-strapped and has not invested in the repair and maintenance of oil facilities and refineries in years. PDVSA saw its June production plunge by 32 percent, with output in the country holding the world’s largest oil reserves plummeting to its lowest level in 75 years in early June when it was just 374,000 bpd. As of this month, Venezuela no longer has any operational oil rigs after the last oilfield services firm that was still drilling for oil in the country holding the world’s largest crude oil reserves pulled its only rig out of service.  ",-0.9912,negative
Russia Doesnt Expect OPEC To Change Course.html,"The OPEC+ panels will not be discussing next week any revisions of the ongoing production cut pact and are not expected to make any major decisions to tweak the deal, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. The volatile oil market and the highly uncertain trajectory of global demand recovery has forced the OPEC+ group to have the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) hold meetings every month until the end of 2020, instead of ahead of every full OPEC+ meeting only. The meetings of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) will and the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) for August are scheduled for August 17 and August 18, respectively, OPEC said in its July meeting at which it noted that market conditions and conformity levels were improving. The JMMC meeting will likely be held on August 19, a day later than originally planned, Russia’s news agency TASS quoted Novak as saying.
 No one has put forward any sudden proposals for changes or additional proposals regarding the cuts, Novak said. As of August 1, the OPEC+ group – led by Saudi Arabia and Russia – is easing the record collective cut of 9.7 million bpd to 7.7 million bpd. “I think that our long-term planning has shown that the right decisions were taken and that the market is now more or less stabilized,” the Russian minister said.  Related: Iran Seizes Oil Tanker In Strait Of Hormuz “We are seeing a gradual rebalancing of the market,” Novak noted.
 The OPEC+ panel meetings next week come as growing concerns about the lasting impact of the coronavirus pandemic has prompted OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to revise down their oil demand projections for this year, acknowledging that COVID-19 would impact oil demand more than previously thought. Due to the coronavirus shock to the global economy, the world’s oil demand is expected to drop by 9.1 million bpd in 2020 – a larger demand loss than OPEC had estimated just a month ago, the cartel said on Wednesday.   On Thursday, the IEA downgraded its oil demand forecast for this year by 140,000 bpd from last month’s projection. This was the first downgrade in several months, “reflecting the stalling of mobility as the number of Covid-19 cases remains high, and weakness in the aviation sector,” the IEA said.  ",-0.9359,negative
America Could Go Fully Electric Right Now.html,"Complete electrification and close to 100 percent renewable energy generation: this is a vision of the United States 15 years from now. According to the visionaries, this objective is completely possible to achieve, and the transition to it would be painless. But can this vision really become a reality? Mass electrification is not a new concept. In fact, the dominant opinion concerning energy transition is that the only way to get to a low-emissions or even emission-free future is by electrifying everything we can electrify. But most voices in this field believe we need to innovate more to get there. Unlike them, the founders of Rewire America, an organization dedicated to solving both the climate change problem and the U.S. unemployment problem, say the country can electrify using nothing more than the technology we have available today. According to a report released by Rewire America in late July, it is all about scale. All it would take to go from one of the top carbon emitters in the world to zero-emissions is building more wind farms, more solar farms, more batteries, and more heat pumps. It would also take selling many more electric cars and expanding the power grid because the U.S. would need to generate a lot more electricity than it generates now. Although it may sound counterintuitive at first, despite this greater electricity demand, total energy demand would fall substantially, the report’s authors say. The logic seems to be that with the elimination of fossil fuels, a lot of energy demand will be eliminated, too. For instance, if everyone switches from internal combustion engine cars to EVs, the energy necessary to find, pump out, and refine the fuel needed to power those ICE cars will go away. The rest of the energy the country needs will be supplied by electricity, almost entirely generated from wind and solar, as well as some nuclear. Generation capacity, according to Saul Griffith and Sam Calisch, would need to jump from the current 450 GW to between 1,500 to 2,000 GW. Nuclear capacity would need to double to 200 GW.  Related: Iranian Oil Exports Much Higher Than Official Data Suggests
 Other than this sizable boost in power generation capacity, changes include a lot more distributed power generation systems, a lot of battery storage installations, and, as mentioned already, an adjustment of the grid. This, the authors note, will create 25 million jobs over the medium term and five million jobs over the long term. And it will all cost as much as Joe Biden plans to spend on addressing climate change: some $3 trillion over a decade. The electrification hype is in full swing, skeptics might say. Yet the Rewire America report makes one stipulation that sets it apart: it can be done with existing technology. We don’t need more sophisticated battery arrays or better wind turbine blades, or more efficient solar panels. We can do it with what we have now. This is not something that many agree on, but it makes sense. Insisting on more innovation to bring about the renewable revolution is, from a certain perspective, an excuse not to go all-in now. From another perspective, either with or without further innovation, this revolution is not happening. For one thing, an almost exclusive reliance on electricity to power an economy—especially an economy the size of the American one—is a bit far-fetched in the period set by the report, according to some. IRENA says that the global share of electricity in the energy mix could rise from the current 20 percent to close to 45 percent, but not until 2050. In some places, the agency said in its Global Energy Transformation roadmap, this share could increase to 60 percent and maybe even higher, but the share of renewables in it would be about 60 percent. IRENA recognizes wind and solar alone, or with modest help from hydrogen and nuclear, cannot do it on their own.  Related: Has The Oil Market Finally Turned A Corner?
 Then there is the topic of space. Wind farms— and to an even greater extent, solar farms—require space. Tripling the current U.S. generation capacity with only wind and solar—and some nuclear—would mean using up a lot of land. Although the United States has lots of land, much of it is currently in use as arable land. There are also places that are not suitable for either wind or solar power generation. That’s one of the challenges of renewables: they need optimal conditions. Otherwise, the electricity they produce would not be profitable. The third challenge would be changing people’s attitudes. This may well turn out to be the biggest challenge of all. The rest is doable: the technology is there, and perhaps the money is there. Even the land is there as such. But how do you convince millions of people to switch from ICE cars to EVs and to install a rooftop solar system on their house complete with battery storage? Sure, government incentives would help, but it is arguable that they would help with the mass adoption Rewire America sees as the only way to deal with climate change. And again, solar panels on every roof might not be the solution for all: some places are not as sunny as others, not to mention snowy places where the solar roof would be rendered useless for hours and maybe even days on end. These places would need very high-capacity batteries, and these do not come cheap. Electrifying a whole country is certainly an interesting idea. Creating millions of jobs in the process makes it a noble idea. But the obstacles to making this idea actually work may well prove insurmountable without a mental rewiring, and for better or worse, we still don’t have the technology to do that, not in such a short period.",0.9981,positive
Oilfield Service Companies Are Bailing On The Permian.html,"The United States shale revolution didn’t just transform West Texas, and it didn’t just transform the energy sector, and it didn’t just transform the entire U.S. economy. It was a boom felt around the world. As the United States flooded international markets with cheap and plentiful shale oil and gas over the past decades, it shaped whole economies, industries, and communities around it. And now, as that revolution winds down, it’s hard to say where the damage will end. It’s been a hard year for all oil markets, as the spread of the novel coronavirus decimated global oil demand. Matters were made worse when the OPEC+ leading nations of Saudi Arabia and Russia disagreed over how to respond to flagging oil demand, which then devolved into an all-out oil price war, causing a massive global oil glut and pushing oil storage to a premium. While this series of unfortunate events negatively impacted the Brent international crude oil benchmark, no market was hit as hard as the U.S. At its worst, the West Texas Intermediate shale benchmark plunged into previously unthinkable negative territory, ending the day of April 20th at nearly $40 below zero per barrel. The effects in the Permian Basin have been devastating. Countless legions of oilfield employees have been fired or furloughed, companies have fallen like dominoes, and shut-in wells have become a painfully common sight. Goldman Sachs has reported that listed domestic oil producers have cut their capital expenditure by a whopping 50 percent. Oilprice has already reported on the way that Texas oil towns are drying up along with the wells, and last week the Financial Times reported on another sector that is significantly impacted by the shale bust.  “Parched US shale patch crushes oilfield services sector,” The Financial Times headline proclaims. The report is about the exodus of oilfield services companies like Halliburton, which “do everything from drilling producers’ wells and laying pipes to maintaining roads and operating software.” When U.S. shale was exploding, these companies reaped major benefits and brought in boatloads of cash, but times have changed. “With the worst price crash in decades wreaking havoc on a sector that has booked tens of billions of dollars in writedowns over the past year, [oilfield services companies] are looking to turn away from the country in the clearest sign yet that the shale patch’s glory days may be over,” writes the Financial Times.   Related: Big Oil Forced To Change Strategy After The Oil Price Crash
  Halliburton, one of the biggest oil services groups in the world, is no exception. “North America is going to be a changed market moving forward,” Halliburton chief financial officer Lance Loeffler told the Times. “Our view is that the international markets will take share back from a supply perspective . . . and we need to be prepared for that.”  Most of the capital expenditures that have been slashed by U.S. oil producers this year “would have been spent on work carried out by oilfield services groups, whose revenues collapsed.” This has meant massive writedowns across the sector, and more lean times on the horizon. “The big three service providers — Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, which have a combined market capitalisation of $55bn — have taken writedowns of almost $45bn over the past year.”  Even as oil prices rebound, the shale sector can’t be expected to bounce back to where they were before this year. For one thing, shale was already on the decline before the COVID-19 pandemic. What’s more, now that so many shale companies have declared bankruptcy or shut-in their wells, pre-COVID production capacity is no longer a possibility without serious time and investment. Restarting a shut-in well also requires significantly more time and capital than it does to stop production in the first place. And then there is the fact that oilfield service companies have also shut down much of their own activity. 
 “Schlumberger, the biggest services group, said last week it had closed 150 North American facilities, while Halliburton said it had got rid of 100,” reports the Financial Times.  In short: shale isn’t dead, but don’t expect a major rebound any time soon.",-0.991,negative
US Oil Production To Fall More Than Expected This Year.html,"U.S. crude oil production will drop by an average of 990,000 barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration, for an average of 11.26 million bpd. That is a far greater loss than the agency expected during its previous forecast made in the July Short Term Energy Outlook.  In July, the EIA had forecast that crude oil production in the United States would fall by an average of 620,000 barrels per day for the full year 2020. The caveat? That the August STEO “remains subject to heightened levels of uncertainty because mitigation and reopening efforts related to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continue to evolve,” the EIA warned.
 The assumptions for this month’s STEO were based on macroeconomic forecasts from IHS Markit, which assumes that GDP fell 5.2% in H1 2020, and will rise from Q3 2020 through 2021. In addition to the reduced outlook for U.S. oil production, the STEO sees high crude inventory levels and excess production capacity as a drag on oil prices in the coming months. The EIA’s estimate for global liquid fuels production came in at an average 91.8 million barrels per day in Q2—8.6 million bpd less than the same period in 2019, driven by production quotas for OPEC and reduced production in the United States due to low oil prices.
 The EIA, however, is expecting U.S. production to average 11.14 barrels per day next year, a small decline than what it was forecasting last month. That is as U.S. oil demand next year is expected to rebound by 1.57 million bpd to 20.03 million bpd.",-0.872,negative
Oil Prices Leap Higher On Bullish Inventory Data.html,"Crude oil prices got another lift today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 4.5 million barrels for the week to August 7. At 514.1 million barrels, inventories remain above the five-year average for this time of the year despite several hefty weekly draws, including one of 7.4 million barrels for the first week of August. Analysts had expected the authority to report an inventory draw of 3.2 million barrels. The EIA report comes on the heels of the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly estimate, which saw inventories had shed 4.4 million barrels in the week to August 7, pushing prices higher.
 In gasoline, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 700,000 barrels for last week, compared with a moderate increase of 419,000 barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production last week increased, to 9.6 million barrels daily, from 9.3 million bpd a week earlier. In distillate fuels, the authority estimated an inventory draw of 2.3 million barrels for the week to August 7, which compared with a build of 1.6 million barrels for the previous week, Distillate fuel production stood at an average of 4.8 million bpd last week, compared with 4.9 million bpd a week earlier. Distillate fuel inventories have been slower than gasoline ones to come down and they remain high above the seasonal five-year average, Reuters’ John Kemp noted last week. At the time, distillate fuel inventories were close to 180 million barrels, the highest since the early 1980s, and 38 million barrels above the five-year average.
 Amid this buildup of distillates, caused in no small part to the still continuing depression in air travel, refineries processed 14.7 million barrels daily of crude oil last week. This was up slightly on the previous week, when refineries in the U.S. processed 14.6 million barrels of crude daily. Brent crude was trading at $45.22 a barrel at the time of writing, with West Texas Intermediate at $42.40 a barrel, both slightly up on Tuesday’s close.",-0.9601,negative
OPEC Admits That 2020 Oil Demand Is Worse Than Expected.html,"Due to the coronavirus shock to the global economy, the world’s oil demand is expected to drop by 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2020 – a larger demand loss than the cartel had estimated just a month ago.     In its closely-watched Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) published on Wednesday, OPEC now forecasts that the global economy will shrink by 4.0 percent this year, more than the 3.7-percent economic drop expected in the July forecast, due to the additional negative impact of the pandemic.   Due to lower economic activity levels in some major developing countries, this year’s global oil demand is now forecast to reach 90.6 million bpd—a drop of 9.1 million bpd compared to 2019. The expected decline in demand is around 100,000 bpd larger than OPEC had forecast last month.
 In 2021, global oil demand is set to grow by 7.0 million bpd, with the expected rise unchanged from last month’s projection. “The forecast assumes that COVID-19 will largely be contained globally, with no further major disruptions to the global economy,” OPEC noted in its report. The cartel noted, however, that for 2021 “Large uncertainties prevail, possibly resulting in a negative impact on petroleum consumption going forward. During exceptional times the normal relationship between disposable income and oil demand does not hold up.”
 As of June, commercial oil stocks in OECD countries were still rising, according to OPEC estimates. At 3.240 billion barrels, they were 301.5 million barrels higher than the same time a year ago, and 291.2 million barrels above the latest five-year average. “Looking ahead, crude and product price developments in 2H20 will continue to be impacted by concerns over a second wave of infections and higher global stocks. Product inventories may remain elevated due to weak road and air transport fuel demand, while gasoil, fuel oil and naphtha prices are expected to continue to receive some support from sectors less affected by the pandemic such as the home heating and petrochemical sectors,” OPEC said. As far as OPEC’s crude oil production in July in concerned, secondary sources data showed that OPEC’s output rose by 980,000 bpd month over month to average 23.17 million bpd—close to the estimates in the monthly Reuters survey, after Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE ended their voluntary one-month over-compliance of a collective 1 million bpd. Of note in the July production is OPEC’s secondary sources estimate that oil production in Iraq – the biggest laggard in compliance which has promised to cut much more to offset poor compliance – saw its production rise by 39,000 bpd to average 3.752 million bpd.     ",-0.9908,negative
China To Expand Its Influence In The Middle East With Major Oil Deal.html,"China continues to expand its influence in the Middle East through oil and infrastructure deals, and the latest deal with ADNOC is a great example of how Beijing looks to grow its presence in the offshore oil business It is little surprise to see that China – again – figures in yet another concessions award in the Middle East, this time relating to the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). In the aftermath of Saudi Arabia’s second disastrous oil price war against the U.S. shale sector, virtually all major Middle Eastern state-owned oil firms are looking to plug varyingly significant operational deficits, as are their governments. In the absence of a sudden major spike in oil prices, economic survival in practical terms now comes down to one of two broad options. The first is to sell off chunks of state assets in initial public offerings (IPOs) or stakes in ongoing oil and gas projects, which ADNOC recently did with the sale of a 49 per cent stake in its gas pipelines for just over US$10 billion to international investors. The second is to sell-off the same assets to companies from countries for which the immediate economic shortfall inherent in such deals pales into insignificance compared to the longer-term geopolitical and financial advantages. In this latter regard, Russia has its own financial constraints to deal with but China does not. Specifically, ADNOC has announced the transfer of ownership rights in its Lower Zakum, and Umm Shaif and Nasr offshore concessions from the existing holding of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to China National Offshore Oil Corporation’s (CNOOC) subsidiary, CNOOC Limited. This will be done by CNOOC acquiring a 40 per cent interest in CNPC’s majority-owned subsidiary PetroChina Investment Overseas (Middle East) Ltd (PetroChina) through its holding company, CNOOC Hong Kong Holding Limited (CNOOC HK). After the proposal has been approved by Abu Dhabi’s Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) – a rubber-stamping affair - CNOOC will join the principal operating consortium in the Lower Zakum concession, comprising India’s ONGC Videsh (10 per cent stake), Japan’s INPEX Corporation (10 per cent), China’s CNPC (6 per cent), Italy’s Eni (5 per cent), and France’s Total (5 per cent). CNOOC will also join the principal operating consortium in the Umm Shaif and Nasr concession, comprising Total (20 per cent), Eni (10 per cent), and CNPC (6 percent). ADNOC will retain a 60 per cent majority ownership interest in both concessions.  Related: Iranian Oil Exports Much Higher Than Official Data Suggests
 Significantly, aside from the broader relentless expansion of China into the Middle East, in line with its multi-generational ‘One Belt, One Road’ programme, this deal marks the first time a dedicated Chinese offshore oil and gas company has joined in any ADNOC concession. These points did not go unnoticed by the chairman of CNOOC, Wang Dongjin, who said: “CNOOC will leverage our extensive expertise in the offshore sector and be dedicated to value creation in these concessions for our mutual benefit.” In this context, this latest deal follows the signing on 22 July 2019 of a comprehensive framework agreement between ADNOC and CNOOC to ‘explore new opportunities for collaboration’ in the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil sectors as well as in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Described at the time by ADNOC chief executive officer, Ahmed Al Jaber as “far-reaching”, the deal is such a significant move by China into the core oil and gas interests of one of the U.S.’s few remaining vocal allies in the Middle East - the UAE - that the deal signing ceremony was attended in person by China’s President, Xi Jinping. Although couched in the usual platitudes expected in such deals, even the official guidance on its contents highlighted its vast scope and scale. For example, ADNOC and CNOOC, according to the official published notes on the agreement, will ‘share knowledge, best practices and technologies in ultra-sour gas development to improve operational efficiency in gas processing and treatment, deliver efficiency, performance and reliability for drilling operations and develop field and reservoir development plans’. As an adjunct to this, China’s Offshore Oil Engineering Company (COOEC) would be in prime position for associated engineering, procurement and construction opportunities, as would China Oilfield Services Ltd (COSL) for the supply of oilfield services and to explore collaboration opportunities in offshore oil and gas field assets in Abu Dhabi.  Related: Big Oil Forced To Change Strategy After The Oil Price Crash Also according to the July 2019 agreement, ADNOC and CNOOC would jointly explore LNG sales and purchase opportunities, share knowledge and expertise in LNG markets, and evaluate partnerships and joint investment opportunities in the LNG value chain. Finally, in the downstream sector, the two companies would collaborate in new integrated refining and petrochemical assets in China, co-operate in CNOOC’s refining assets, and jointly partner and invest in the refining and petrochemical value chain.
 One of these early, albeit indirect, China investments may well be into an investment platform to fund local chemicals projects, as part of an overall push to invest US$45 billion in downstream activities in Abu Dhabi, according to a senior oil and gas industry source familiar with the project. The investment platform is to be run as a joint project between ADNOC and the Abu Dhabi state-owned holding company, ADQ (formerly known as the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company) and will oversee the development of projects in the planned Ruwais Derivatives Park. Although ADNOC has not made public the breakdown of where all of the funding is to come from, ADNOC and ADQ together will hold a 60 stake in the project. That the ADQ has any money at all for such an investment, or indeed for anything at all, is surprising, given that less than two months ago it was in urgent talks to raise a loan of “at least US$3 billion”, according to various reports. “ADQ’s attempts to put together a syndicate of banks did not go well and yet here it is with investment funding, at a time when the broader deal with China is moving forward,” he said. “There are no public statements that China is involved in the funding, of course, but it is fair to say that if ADQ or ADNOC had asked China for funding for the investment platform then China would have given it,” he concluded.",0.9986,positive

Iranian Oil Exports Much Higher Than Official Data Suggests.html,"Iran is exporting a lot more crude oil than U.S. figures suggest, data from TankerTrackers.com has revealed, as reported by NBC News. According to the data, Iran is exporting as much as 600,000 barrels daily, using ship-to-ship transfers with transponders turned off to avoid detection, skirting U.S. sanctions. The daily average number compares with an estimate of 227,000 bpd made in a U.S. Congressional report, NBC’s Raf Sanchez wrote on Twitter.
 TankerTrackers.com first reported in 2018, after President Trump reintroduced sanctions on Iranian exports, that Iranian tankers were turning off their transponders to hide the destination of their journeys. At the time, most tanker tracking data came precisely from transponders and port authorities, which made most Iranian tanker movement reports unreliable. Last year, a U.S. State Department official told media that the department was tracking ship-to-ship transfers and was working with other governments to ensure they, too, were keeping track of such moves that became one of few ways for Iran to still get its crude to foreign markets.
 Most of Iran’s oil is going to China one way or another. In fact, as Simon Watkins reported earlier this month for Oilprice.com, China has been stocking up on cheap Iranian crude. Citing an unnamed oil industry source close to Tehran’s oil ministry, Watkins said China took in some 8.1 million barrels of Iranian oil between June 1 and July 21. Official reports from China said the country had not imported any Iranian crude in June. But not all Iranian oil reaches China directly from Iran, as TankerTrackers.com’s co-founder Samir Madani told Oilprice.com earlier this year. As Oilprice’s Watkins notes in his recent report, citing Iranian sources in the know, much of it comes into China via Malaysia and, some of it, via Indonesia. The sanction-skirting move involves hanging a tanker’s registration documents that point to its origin and ownership to make it look like the oil comes from Malaysia or Indonesia.",-0.6119,negative
OPECs No2 Drags Down Output Cut Compliance Rate.html,"Since the landmark deal that saw OPEC+ agree to cut nearly 10 million barrels per day of oil production to clear the global gut created by the coronavirus pandemic and wreckless production on behalf of Saudi Arabia and a handful of eager producers, one thing has threatened the cartel’s success: the OPEC laggards. And Iraq is still dragging down the rest of the group’s compliance rate, according to official Iraq production figures for July. Iraq has been promising to stick to the production cut deal since the beginning of July, but the market mostly dismissed Iraq’s optimism. Saudi Arabia did manage to get Nigeria and Iraq to agree to make up for any overproduction in May and June—and now July—by continuing to underproduce their quota in August and even beyond.
 And oil prices are ever watchful of OPEC+’s production cut performance. But according to SOMO, Iraq—who had said it would make some headway in July towards sticking more closely to its quota—made close to zero progress in doing so. Iraq produced 3.697 million barrels of oil per day in July, compared with 3.698 million barrels per day in June. This compares with its 3.592 quota.
 In August, Iraq was originally supposed to produce 3.804 million barrels per day. But Iraq must now cut an additional 400,000 bpd to make up for the overages of the last few months. But Iraq has a problem, and while Iraq may be willing to cut production, its semi-autonomous Kurdish region and foreign oil company presence make this tricky to implement. And without any fundamental changes, Iraq’s likelihood of hitting their target in August is about as likely as it was in July, or June, or May. Iraq will now have to answer to OPEC’s technical monitoring committee, which will meet next week.",0.628,positive
Russia Looks To Lure Shell Into New Arctic Oil Project.html,"Central now to Russia’s hydrocarbons-related power is its Arctic sector oil and gas reserves. These comprise over 35,700 billion cubic metres of natural gas and over 2,300 million metric tons of oil and condensate, principally located in the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas. According to recent comments from Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, the next 10-15 years will witness a dramatic expansion in the extraction of these Arctic resources, and a build-out of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) as the main transport route to monetise these resources in the global hydrocarbons markets. To these ends, last week saw the announcement of a joint venture (JV) between Russia’s third biggest oil company by output and the oil arm of state gas giant Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, and Anglo-Dutch super-major, Royal Dutch Shell (Shell).  In broad terms, the JV will focus on the exploration and development of oil and gas resources along the Gydan peninsula area, with an immediate focus on the Leskinsky and Pukhutsyayakhsky licence blocks. To date, according to Gazprom Neft, little exploration work has been carried out on these two licence blocks, which are a considerable distance from any existing transport and oil and gas infrastructure. This said, both appear to be good prospects, with the Leskinsky block (located in the Taimyr district of Krasnoyarsk) estimated to contain at least 100 million metric tons (733 million barrels) of oil equivalent across its 3,000+ square km area, according to Gazprom Neft. The Pukhutsyayakhsky block is estimated to hold at least 35 million metric tons (256.5 million barrels) of oil equivalent, albeit over a much smaller exploration and development area (800 square km).  According to Gazprom Neft, two-dimensional seismic studies have been completed on both blocks, giving positive results, and drilling of the first well at the Leskinsky block is scheduled for 2020. Gazprom Neft-GEO will act as the operator on the exploration work at both blocks, and after the usual corporate and regulatory approvals, the deal should be completed by the end of the year, with each partner holding exactly 50 per cent in the JV.   Related: Are Oil Majors Giving Up On Guyana? The development of the two blocks will neatly augment Gazprom Neft’s increasingly Arctic-leaning business, with the area accounting for around 30 percent of the company’s oil production in 2019. The company started exporting oil produced in the Arctic sector from as early as 2013 and since then it has delivered at least 40 million tons of oil – including both the ARCO (Prirazlomnoye field) and Novy Port (Novoportovskoye field) blends – to various European countries. Last month saw Gazprom Neft’s highly-significant first Arctic oil delivery to China via the NSR and last week saw a similar first, albeit for Russia’s Novatek, with its inaugural delivery of a cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its flagship Yamal LNG project to Japan via the NSR.  Both deliveries highlight the potential to exponentially ramp-up oil and gas product exports to key Asian markets via the NSR’s Eastern delivery route. To this specific end, Novatek is right now working on developing a trans-shipment terminal in Kamchatka to enable LNG to be unloaded from the specialised ice-class tanker fleet onto traditional LNG vessels. Last week, Novatek’s first deputy chairman, Lev Feodosyev, stated that these efforts to enhancing its LNG export logistics: “will significantly expand our opportunities to cost competitively deliver and supply LNG to the entire Asia-Pacific region.”
 All of these developments have come despite the still in-place U.S. sanctions on Russia, primarily as a result of Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and negative rhetoric from the U.S. on Russian hydrocarbons expansion is increasing. Most notably, the U.S. State Department on 15 July updated part of its ‘Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act’ (CAATSA) legislation to allow for the targeting of companies involved in building the Nord Stream 2 gas link to Germany and the second line of the TurkStream gas pipeline to southern Europe.   Related: Alberta Missed Its Chance To Mint A Province Of Oil Millionaires The U.S. Congress is also considering an additional element to the Nord Stream 2 sanctions - the ‘Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Clarification Act’ - which would target even more companies involved in building the project’s final segment. If implemented, these new sanctions could hit at least another 120 companies across a multitude of business sectors from more than 12 European countries, according to a comment last week from a Nord Stream 2 spokesperson.  It may be that Shell’s involvement in the JV with Gazprom Neft in the Arctic is a reaction at least in part to the increasing U.S. threats in Europe. As recently as April reports were that Shell had withdrawn from a wider deal with Gazprom Neft to develop five fields and licence areas in the Yamal-Nenets region. That JV had tentatively been named ‘Meretoyakhaneftegaz’ and had also involved Spain’s Repsol, until it too withdrew a month after Shell. The ‘Meretoyakhaneftegaz’ project looked to be a natural addition to Shell’s existing operational footprint in Russia, which includes a stake in oil JV Salym Petroleum with Gazprom Neft and a partnership in the major Sakhalin 2 oil, gas and LNG project. 
 At the time that it withdrew, Shell stated that it had exited the project due to “the challenging external environment”, although whether that meant the operational landscape, the U.S.’ increasingly hostile attitude to doing business with Russia, or a combination thereof remained unclear. It is clear, though, that Shell is also one of Nord Stream 2’s five core investors, along with France’s Engie, Austria’s OMV, and Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall Dea (with each  committing to pay EUR950 million). “It’s becoming increasingly clear that there is a growing feeling of resentment in Europe to what it regards as U.S. interference in European affairs,” a senior oil and gas industry figure with close knowledge of the European Commission’s  energy security policies told OilPrice.com last week. “This really began back with the revelations by Edward Snowden in 2013 that the U.S.’s NSA [National Security Agency] had spied on European Union members and had tapped [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, which, for Merkel – who had grown up in the Stasi [secret police]-run East Germany - was intolerable, and she has never forgiven them,” he said.  “You could see this distaste for the U.S. ‘meddling’ in European-only affairs, when the E.U. refused to go along with the U.S. in its withdrawal from the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ nuclear deal with Iran or the subsequent sanctions, and the Nord Stream argument is part of exactly the same thing and dates right back to Merkel’s phone being bugged,” he underlined. Indeed, very recently, German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, said that by announcing measures that threaten European companies with sanctions: “The U.S. Administration is disrespecting Europe’s right and sovereignty to decide itself where and how we source our energy…European energy policy is decided in Europe and not in Washington.” ",0.9518,positive
Big Oil Forced To Change Strategy After The Oil Price Crash.html,"In one of the most challenging quarters for the oil industry in recent memory, the five Big Oil firms wrote down nearly US$50 billion from the value of their oil and gas assets as commodity prices crashed and as some of them strategically reset their expectations of oil prices going forward. The five international oil majors – ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and Total – also reduced capital expenditure (capex) plans as well as their oil and gas production as demand crashed in the second quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  All majors – apart from the notable exception of Exxon – recalibrated the value of their oil and gas assets in the second quarter due to the crash in oil prices and expectations of depressed demand for at least several more quarters. The second quarter saw some of the worst quarterly figures at Big Oil in decades, and while the overall impression was that of a dismal quarter, the majors responded in different ways to the crash in oil prices and demand.  At one end of the range, Exxon didn’t book any major write-downs this past quarter and kept its dividend. At the other end of the range of responses to the crash, BP not only slashed its dividend in half and booked billions of U.S. dollars of impairments, but it also announced a strategic shift to cut its oil production by 40 percent and increase investments in low-carbon energy tenfold within a decade.  Exxon reported its second consecutive quarterly loss, which was the worst loss for the U.S. supermajor in its modern history. It reiterated its commitment to dividend payouts while evaluating its businesses on a country-by-country basis after having identified “significant potential for additional reductions.”  A week after the results release, Exxon said in an SEC filing that the low oil prices could result in 20-percent reductions to its proved reserves at end 2020, compared to 22.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels reported at year-end 2019.
  Related: Libya's Oil Blockade Will Help Clear The Global Supply Glut “If average prices seen thus far in 2020 persist for the remainder of the year, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas will not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020,” Exxon said.  Unlike Exxon, the other U.S. supermajor, Chevron, booked impairments – at a total of US$5 billion – as it also reported its worst quarterly results in three decades. Chevron’s charges include US$1.8 billion mostly associated with downward revisions to its commodity price outlook, full impairment of its US$2.6 billion investment in Venezuela, and a US$780 million charge due to severance accruals as it plans to cut 13 percent, or around 6,000 jobs, of its workforce.  Across the Atlantic, European majors Shell and Total managed to avoid adjusted losses thanks to their keen oil trading businesses that cushioned the blow from the low oil prices.  Yet, both Shell and Total also booked impairments connected to their revised oil price outlooks. Shell booked an impairment charge of US$16.8 billion post-tax as it revised its price assumptions and market fundamentals. Total booked US$8.1 billion impairments – of which US$7 billion in Canada’s oil sands – as it cut its short-term price expectations.  “Beyond 2030, given technological developments, particularly in the transportation sector, Total anticipates oil demand will have reached its peak and Brent prices should tend toward the long-term price of 50$/b, in line with the IEA SDS scenario,” Total said.  Total, however, kept its dividend intact, becoming the only European major to not resort to dividend cuts so far this year. Equinor and Shell slashed dividends as early as reporting their first-quarter results at end-April-early May, while Eni and BP announced dividend cuts with the Q2 results in the past two weeks. 
  Related: Oil Prices Post Weekly Gain Despite Struggling Demand BP halved its dividend, reducing the payout to shareholders for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. The dividend cut was not a surprise—it was widely expected by analysts. While the dividend was one headline-grabbing story, the other was the fact that BP pledged to reduce its oil and gas production by 40 percent by 2030 as part of its strategy to reinvent itself from an International Oil Company (IOC) to an Integrated Energy Company (IEC).  BP had pledged to become a net-zero energy business by 2050 in early February before the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the world and led to analysts thinking whether oil demand will ever return to pre-crisis levels.  Commenting on BP’s strategy unveiled last week, Luke Parker, Wood Mackenzie Vice President, Corporate Analysis, said: “But if ever there was a moment to reset, this was it. Several factors have converged to make it possible: coronavirus and everything that comes with it; a strategic pivot to net-zero on the horizon; Shell’s dividend reset; a new leadership with credit in the bank. Our view is that BP has taken the prudent course of action.” ",-0.9685,negative
Aramco Aims To Boost Production Capacity To 13 Million Bpd.html,"While the world is still awash with oil that it cannot quickly get rid of during a time of historic demand crumbling, the world’s largest oil company is looking to raise its production capacity by an extra million barrels per day, according to Reuters. Should the market be fearful? Aramco’s CEO Amin Nasser has confirmed that it is moving ahead with its plans to boost its oil production capacity from 12 million barrels per day to 13 million bpd, causing concern in a market that is already reeling under the weight of excess inventory. This, despite the OPEC+ production cut agreement that has been in effect for quite some time—and mainly carried by none other than Saudi Arabia—could be construed as curious, given the fact that Saudi Arabia’s production quota over the next few months falls well under that 13 million bpd mark.
 But the question is not whether the market can handle an additional million barrels per day of production. It cannot.  The real question is whether Saudi Aramco can afford to sink money into boosting its capacity by another million barrels per day, given the lousy quarter it just had on the back of lower oil prices and lower volumes—its profit fell 73% in Q2. But it is important to note that Saudi Aramco is just talking about capacity, not production. And it is this threat of an extra million barrels per day that some find alarming.  Saudi Aramco has been in the driver’s seat of the OPEC deals over the last couple of deals, but it also has shouldered most of the burden of that production cut deal. It is unlikely to look fondly on having to go it alone in this regard any longer.
 Having a stick to wield in the form of an extra million barrels per day probably looks pretty handy if Aramco ever hopes to be in a position to strongarm another producing country again—such as Russia, Iraq, Nigeria, or even the United States.  Related: Libya's Oil Blockade Will Help Clear The Global Supply Glut Although, if history is any indication of how that strongarm approach might play out, Aramco should be mindful of that plan backfiring as it did once with U.S. shale producers, and again with Russia—both of which cost Aramco market share and price per barrel. Still, the security of additional capacity—particularly as many oil majors, such as BP, are betting against oil in favor of renewables—may just be a bet worth making. Aramco has long held that oil demand will be around for years to come, with the exception of the current blip, and if it is one of the last major producers, it could take full advantage of that extra capacity.",0.974,positive
Saudi Aramco Asian Oil Demand Recovery Almost At Pre Crisis Levels.html,"The world’s biggest oil-producing and oil-exporting company, state oil giant Saudi Aramco, is optimistic about the pace of oil demand recovery in Asia, chief executive Amin Nasser said on Sunday, helping oil prices rise on Monday. “We are seeing a partial recovery in the energy market as countries around the world take steps to ease restrictions and reboot their economies,” Nasser said in a statement following Aramco’s Q2 report released over the weekend.   Demand for crude oil in Asia has almost returned to the levels from before the pandemic, Bloomberg quoted Nasser as saying.
 At the end of June, Nasser said that the worst in the oil market was over, and noted that he was “very optimistic” for the second half of this year.  In June, global oil demand is somewhere around 90 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 75-80 million bpd in April, Nasser told IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin in an interview for CERAWeek Conversations two months ago. Saudi Aramco’s comments on Sunday about the demand recovery were one of the key reasons for oil prices rising early on Monday, according to analysts.
 In another sign of optimism about demand, data from global flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed on Saturday that on Friday, August 7, there were more than 70,000 commercial flights globally for the first time since March 20. Yet, the number of commercial flights was still down 43.6 percent compared to the same Friday in August 2019. After a drop on Friday, oil prices rose early on Monday, with the U.S. benchmark up more than 2 percent as of 9:47 a.m. EDT. WTI Crude rallied 2.28 percent at $42.21 and Brent Crude was trading above $45—at $45.20, up by 1.76 percent on the day.  ",-0.872,negative
The Oil And Gas Industry Is Going Remote.html,"If there was one thing the last oil price crisis proved, it was this: despite the devastation that low oil prices can wreak on an industry, they can also make oil and gas production more efficient for less money. If there is one thing this crisis is proving, it is that oil and gas companies can do this remotely. In what could well be the industry’s next step towards digitalization, oilfield service providers have been moving more and more of their operations to remote offices—some are even moving some operations to the homes of their employees. And once again, they have been doing more with less, prompted by oil prices falling off a cliff this spring. Home Oilfield The Wall Street Journal’s Colin Eaton reported earlier this month that Baker Hughes and Schlumberger both had two-thirds of their drilling activity supported by remote work during the second quarter of the year. For Schlumberger, this was up 25 percent from the first quarter. For Baker Hughes, it was up 20 percent. Eaton also quoted a Halliburton executive as saying the move from the field to the remote operations center or the home has been an eye-opener in that it has shown the industry that remote work was not as much of a challenge as previously believed. And this means the trend could become a stable one, just like it has for Big Tech. Google and Facebook were among tech companies that extended their work-from-home policies until at least the summer of 2021. Some, such as Twitter, have told employees they could keep working remotely forever. But drilling an oil well requires the physical presence of a crew. It is not all done on a computer… except it increasingly is. The oil and gas industry has been rather selective in its adoption of digital products to optimize its business. This may be about to change, a survey by analytics and advisory firm Quantzig recently revealed. According to the survey, the industry should go all-in for digital to utilize the potential of information technology, and the time to do it is right now.
  Related: Oil Drops As Demand Recovery Stalls “Such a transformation will require organizations to implement a focused digital strategy backed by technology adoption,” said Quantzig. “It will also need investment and commitment to revisit and revamp processes, infrastructure, and systems. All the enablers required for a successful transformation will have to come into play for the industry to harness the true potential of digitalization.” Jobs Gone Forever Automation is a big part of the digitalization of the oil industry. It will eventually render many jobs in the field—manual jobs—obsolete. This means that some jobs lost now to the oil price collapse will not be coming back. Back in February, Baker Hughes’ VP of Ventures and Growth, Taylor Shinn, told Oilprice.com in an interview that digitalization did not necessarily mean the loss of jobs. It would actually make it easier to retrain employees and re-assign them, he said. But this was before the pandemic struck, obliterating more than 40,000 jobs in Texas alone, according to data from the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers. In the perfect storm of low prices and low demand, job losses were inevitable from the start. Going remote and going digital will make more job losses inevitable. Yet it is very likely that they will create new ones, too. The rise of the digital worker In December last year, the Houston Chronicle’s Sergio Chapa reported on the rising number of tech labs set up by oil and gas companies to drive forward the digitalization of the industry. These labs were hiring people for positions that had words like “data”, “agile”, and “cloud” in their names.
 As Chapa noted in that report, it was not only a way to take advantage of what many are calling the fourth industrial revolution. It was also a way to make work in oil and gas more appealing to a generation that is more hostile to this industry than those before it as a talent shortage loomed on the oil horizon.   Related: Oil Market Contango Returns In A Sign Of New Glut Yet this shift is first and foremost about bringing oil and gas in the digital era more comprehensively. Drillbit sensors are fine, and so are 3D printed turbines, but the industry is moving towards comprehensive digitalization, it seems, and the pandemic is speeding up the process because remote is safe. Geo-data major Fugro recently said it had completed the first fully remote inspection of an offshore platform in the North Sea. It used a remotely operated vehicle and its remote operations center in Aberdeen. This is just the first instance of what is likely to become standard practice, also featuring virtual reality products such as Baker Hughes’ Phantom View, drones, and smart drills. Baker Hughes told the WSJ’s Eaton that 40 percent of the users of its remote operations services since the start of the year were first-time users. Schlumberger reported that it planned to boost its digital business substantially in what is becoming the new normal for the industry. Halliburton last month struck a deal with Microsoft and Accenture to advance its digital capabilities. The big three are going digital. It will cost thousands of jobs, but it may yet create thousands more.",0.9857,positive

US Sends Crude Oil To Worlds Top Exporter Saudi Arabia.html,"The U.S. sent in June its first crude oil shipment to Saudi Arabia since the ban on crude export was lifted in 2015, which was also the first shipment since one very small shipment back in 2002, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau reported by Reuters. The data showed that the United States shipped in June a total of 550,000 barrels of crude oil to Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude oil exporter, which is also one of the main suppliers of crude to the U.S. During the 40-year ban on U.S. crude oil exports, the United States once shipped 1,000 barrels of oil to Saudi Arabia back in 2002, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.  
 The cargo to Saudi Arabia in June may have been part of a bigger shipment headed for another export destination, traders told Reuters. As of May 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has never recorded any volumes of American crude oil exports to Saudi Arabia in its data series. Saudi Arabia, for its part, has been one of the largest suppliers of crude oil to the United States, and the third-largest supplier of petroleum in 2019 behind Canada and Mexico.
 In May 2020, U.S. imports of Saudi crude oil jumped to a three-year high of 1.151 million barrels per day (bpd) after the Kingdom made good on its promise to flood the market with oil following the collapse of the previous OPEC+ pact in early March. In the previous months of 2020, U.S. imports of Saudi crude had averaged around 400,000 bpd. In April, when Saudi Arabia and Russia struck a new OPEC+ deal to withhold a record volume of supply from the market during the demand collapse, Saudi oil tankers had already loaded significant volumes of crude and were already traveling to the United States.",-0.9909,negative
US Companies Eye Venezuelan Oil Tankers As Debt Payment.html,"O-I Glass Inc, a glass manufacturer, is trying to seize a Venezuelan oil tanker as part of efforts to secure the $500 million in arbitration compensation granted it by a court after Venezuela expropriated two plants, Reuters reports, citing documents filed at a Singapore court. This is the latest in a series of attempts by various companies to collect compensation that courts had granted them after the sweeping nationalization of private businesses undertaken by late Hugo Chavez. And with options few, oil tankers are among the first ones to attract attention.
 If the court grants O-I Glass its request, it would spell more trouble for already struggling PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil firm. The company has been the main target of U.S. sanctions, the latest round focusing on tankers. The sanctions were reportedly to cover all vessels that have called at Venezuelan ports over the 12 months to end-May, prompting many shipping firms to divert vessels that were already en route to Venezuela. The targeting of vessels naturally includes oil tankers, so PDVSA has had to rely on its own fleet of vessels to continue shipping crude oil abroad for vitally needed cash. Even so, exports have collapsed from 1.5 million bpd before the start of sanctions to just 400,000 bpd, according to Reuters. This is the lowest level of oil exports in more than 70 years.
 Meanwhile, drilling rigs have been removed from Venezuelan oil fields as well. According to the Baker Hughes rig count report, as of June, there was one active drilling rig in the country. However, after Chevron folded up and left, pressured by the sanctions, its contractor Nabors Industries followed, leaving it with zero active rigs. PDVSA saw its June production plunge by 32 percent, with output in the country holding the world’s largest oil reserves plummeting to its lowest level in 75 years in early June when it was just 374,000 bpd.",-0.3167,negative
Argentina Scrambles To Salvage Its Shale Boom.html,"Only two years ago analysts were hailing Argentina’s emerging shale oil boom, which many believed would be the next major petroleum frontier in Latin America. The vast Vaca Muerta, or Dead Cow in English, shale formation, which skirts Argentina’s semi-arid Patagonian steppe, is compared to the smaller prolific Permian shale. The EIA estimates that the formation has technically recoverable resources of 16 billion barrels of oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The Vaca Muerta is an enormous resource, ranked as the world’s second-largest gas shale deposit. If executed appropriately, its tremendous hydrocarbon wealth will address many of Argentina’s deep-seated economic ills.  By 2011, the exploitation of the Vaca Muerta had become a top priority for Argentina’s fiscally challenged government. During 2012 President Cristina Fernandez’s administration seized a majority stake of YPF, Argentina’s largest oil producer, from Spanish integrated energy major Repsol. The rationale for the nationalization was that Repsol was failing to adequately exploit the Vaca Muerta’s substantial hydrocarbon wealth, which could be used by Buenos Aires to head-off an emerging energy deficit and financial crisis. This event alarmed the international community, sparked reprisals from Spain and for many international energy companies confirmed Argentina’s pariah status. Consequently, foreign investment inflows plunged, accelerating the deterioration of oil and natural gas production which was crucial to heading-off another economic crisis. These events indicated that Argentina could possibly never unlock the full potential of the vast Vaca Muerta shale because it wouldn’t receive from foreign petroleum companies the capital and technology required. As energy imports soared pressure grew on Argentina’s already fragile economy, forcing Buenos Aires to contemplate other measures to bolster urgently needed fiscal revenues and Argentina’s rapidly declining hydrocarbon output. By 2017, oil production had fallen to a multi-decade low of 479,633 barrels daily.  Related: Oil Prices Climb Despite Growing Demand Fears Pro-business Mauricio Macri’s 2015 ascension to the presidency triggered hope among international financial markets that Argentina had finally come-in from the economic cold. Macri embarked upon a steady process of implementing market friendly reforms which he hoped would bolster confidence in Argentina and foreign investment. Those measures, coupled with the Vaca Muerta’s considerable hydrocarbon potential, attracted the attention of foreign energy majors including ExxonMobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell as well as a raft of smaller oil explorers and producers. That started the transfer of vital technology and capital required to exploit Argentina’s considerable unconventional petroleum resources. As those measures, including the removal of energy subsidies and relaxation of capital controls, gained momentum there was an enormous influx of investment into the Vaca Muerta. By 2018, foreign investment had soared to $11.9 billion, the largest amount in six-years. The Vaca Muerta is estimated to have received around $4 billion of investment during 2018, underscoring the emergence of Argentina’s growing unconventional oil boom.

Chinas Crude Oil Imports Drop From Record Highs.html,"China’s crude oil imports are estimated to have dropped in July by 3 percent from June, but they were still much higher than the import volumes in July 2019, data from energy analytics services provider OilX showed. Following record-high imports in June, China is expected to have imported on average 11.55 million bpd in July, down by 373,000 compared to June, OilX Research data showed.    Despite the monthly drop in Chinese crude oil imports, arrivals in July surged by 21.5 percent, or by 2.05 million bpd, compared to July 2019.
 “The swift increase on imports in recent months is an optimistic sign for the global economy, however the pace has been so quick that it has challenged the logistical capabilities of Chinese ports. In fact, we attribute the abnormally high difference between our estimate and the Customs data to possible discrepancies between the classification of imports and vessels waiting to discharge,” OilX oil analysts Juan Carlos Rodriguez and Valantis Markogiannakis said in a note. According to Reuters calculations of data from China’s General Administration of Customs, China smashed its record from a month earlier and imported an all-time high of 12.9 million bpd of crude, more than 1.5 million bpd higher than the imports in May and a 34-percent jump compared to June last year. According to OilX data for July, China’s imports from the United States jumped by more than 500,000 bpd, driven by the arrivals of vessels booked in April, when Chinese buyers took advantage of the combination of low prices and lack of demand from other countries.
 Yet, such high volumes of imports from the United States are unlikely to be sustainable because of politics and the higher oil prices that may impact China’s future purchases, OilX noted. The overall number of oil cargoes heading to China is expected to moderate in the next few months, which is set to ease the congestion at Chinese ports, according to OilX.",0.6335,positive
Oil Prices Soar After EIA Reports Large Crude Draw.html,"A week after it reported the heftiest crude oil draw in more than six months, the Energy Information Administration once again had good news for oil bulls: the authority said crude oil inventories had shed 7.4 million barrels during the week to July 31. A week earlier, the EIA said inventories had lost as much as 10.6 million barrels, after a build of 4.6 million barrels for the second week of July. Analysts had expected an inventory decline of 3.267 million barrels for the week to July 31. A day before the EIA, the American Petroleum Institute reported an inventory draw of 8.587 million barrels for the last week of July.
 In gasoline, the EIA reported an increase in inventories of 419,000 barrels, after a 700,000-barrel build estimated for the previous week. Gasoline production last week averaged 9.3 million bpd, compared with 9.2 million bpd a week earlier. In distillate fuels, the authority estimated an inventory increase of 1.6 million barrels for the week to July 31. This compared with a build of half a million barrels a week earlier. Production of distillates last week averaged 4.9 million bpd, compared with 4.8 million bpd a week earlier. Prices jumped after the API inventory report on Tuesday, even though worries about the sustainability of any demand improvement remain strong. The rally continued today, too. At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate was trading at $43.25 a barrel, with Brent crude changing hands at $45.94 a barrel, both up by more than 3 percent.
 Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund said it expected crude oil demand to record an 8-percent decline this year. As a result, prices will be 41 percent lower than they were last year on average, the IMF said in a report titled ‘Global imbalances and the COVID-19 crisis’. The IEA meanwhile, updated its oil demand forecast and now expects demand to suffer a 7.9-million-bpd decline this year.

What Will The Post Pandemic Shale Patch Look Like.html,"The global coronavirus pandemic--a true black swan event--has altered the course of the entire oil and gas industry, and not even the mighty US shale industry will emerge unscathed. Employment in the oil and gas industry in the United States has already dropped off considerably in the months following the coronavirus, exacerbated by Russia and Saudi Arabia’s oil price war that saw millions of extra barrels of oil flood into the market, including into the United States. The combination of those two events put remarkable pressure on the shale industry in the United States. And the industry is unlikely to return to normal in the near future--or ever, perhaps. Oil Workers, the Backbone of U.S. Shale According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statics Current Employment Statistics published last month, support activities for oil and gas operations fell by 20% between February and May.  In Texas, the heart of the US shale industry, oil and gas production jobs could fall to a 15-year low in the coming months, according to the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers as cited by the Houston Chronicle. And those jobs may never return.  Drilling and oilfield service companies were hit especially hard. In June, Texas employed 162,350 workers in this field. This is about half of what it was in December 2014. From February to June, Texas shed 46,100 jobs in production and oilfield services.  More Pain to Come Some industry experts see even more job cuts on the horizon, as oil demand isn’t expected to snap back anytime soon. Indeed, in the United States, reports of an increased number of new coronavirus cases have the market spooked, and some government officials at state and local levels are rethinking their plans to reopen--a necessary element in any oil demand recovery.   Related: The Sky Is The Limit For Clean Energy Subsidies In Europe
 Ramanan Krishnamoorti, professor of Petroleum Engineering at the University of Houston’s Cullen College of Engineering, sees the industry “in big trouble,” according to Houston’s abc13.  “You’re going to see a lot of bankruptcies, a lot of furloughs, more than furloughs. You’re going to see layoffs. You’re going to see people leave this entire industry because there aren’t going to be jobs.” Indeed, Schlumberger slashed 25% of its workforce. Halliburton shed more than 5,000 workers in Texas alone, and many companies have filed for bankruptcy within the last couple of months.  Krishnamoorti also sees big oil companies snapping up smaller ones. Case in point, Chevron’s takeover of Noble Energy. His outlook? The industry will snap back, but not for years. Krishnamoorti is not alone. The demand for jet fuel just hasn’t snapped a back like gasoline, and it isn’t going to for years. Jet fuel demand recovery is expected to drag on for years, possibly until 2023, Bank of America suggests.  The length of the demand recovery is expected to pose a grave challenge for the U.S. shale industry. When the industry does snap back down the road--and most analysts agree that it will come back--it may look quite different.  Welcome to the New $40 Per Barrel World Some of the takeaways from the last oil price crisis were mergers and acquisitions, weaker shale companies going under, and the remaining shale companies finding unique ways to improve efficiency and, arguably, better cost discipline.  Some have said that there are few gains left to be made, with most of the less desirable shale companies and inefficiencies within the shale industry going the way of the dinosaur the last go around. In other words, some suggest that the belt is already as tight as it will get. But changes are still afoot because changes must be made. 
 While oil and gas companies have seriously chopped its workforce, shale--like it did last time around--will find a way to do more with less.  Necessity being the mother of invention, U.S. shale is already finding ways to keep production up with a reduced workforce and less capital. They are already making the transition to $40 oil.  This can be seen with the Baker Hughes rig count and with Primary Vision’s Frac Spread Count. While the EIA is showing that U.S. production has sunk 2 million barrels per day on average over the last couple of months, rigs and frac spreads have fallen more sharply than what the current production levels would merit. The New U.S. Shale Industry U.S. shale will still likely emerge from this protracted low-priced environment with some battle scars. When rigs are idled for a long period of time, they are more likely to be idled forever. According to Clay Bretches, executive vice president at Apache Corp, “When you shut in wells, especially for a long period of time, you have a lot of surprises. Some of them are good and some of them are bad,” Bloomberg reported back in May. One of those surprises is finding out that there is reservoir damage due to prolonged idling. Some smaller businesses that do not have the capital to make necessary changes will go under. Some necessary workers will be lost to other industries forever.  Nothing would make OPEC and Russia happier than to put U.S. shale on the backfoot. But just because U.S. shale may emerge from these difficult times with battle wounds doesn’t mean OPEC should count it out.  U.S. shale has proved fantastically resilient in the past to any downturn, even long ones. It may look different, yes indeed. Perhaps smaller, as some analysts say. But a few years down the road, and U.S. shale will still be a force that OPEC must reckon with.",0.9426,positive
IMF Global Oil Demand Will Shrink By 8 In 2020.html,"The coronavirus crisis will lead to global oil demand dropping by around 8 percent this year compared to last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a new report, as carried by Qatari daily The Penunsula. This year, oil prices will be 41 percent lower than in 2019, the IMF said in its ‘Global imbalances and the COVID-19 crisis’ external report. The direct impact of the low oil prices on oil trade balances will vary across economies, reflecting their dependence on oil exports and imports, according to the IMF.  The fund’s estimates for this year’s global oil demand decline are in line with other forecasters such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC.
 Last month, the IEA said in its latest Oil Market Report that global oil demand was set to crash by 7.9 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, but this forecast is slightly more optimistic than last month’s expectation of an 8.1-million-bpd demand drop. The IEA, however, noted that the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the reinstating of partial lockdowns in some countries continue to contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the world’s global oil demand in 2020. This year, the world is expected to consume an average of 92.1 million bpd of oil, compared to the typical demand of 100 million bpd, the IEA said.
 OPEC, for its part, expects overall global oil demand to drop by 8.9 million bpd in 2020, before rising by 7 million bpd in 2021, when it will still be lower than demand in 2019. The oil price plunge and the production cuts after the coronavirus pandemic will hit oil exporters in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) hard, with the combined oil income for those countries expected to plummet by US$270 billion this year compared to 2019, the IMF said in its latest update on the region last month.",-0.9688,negative
Despite Official Reports China Has Been Hoarding Iranian Crude Oil.html,"A number of high-profile reports last week cited data released on 26 July by China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC) as clear evidence that China did not import any crude oil from Iran in June ‘for the first time since January 2007’. This is absolute nonsense. Not only is China continuing to import many millions of barrels of crude oil from Iran every single month but also it will continue to do so in line with the now firmly in-play 25-year deal between the two countries.   Specifically, from 1 June to 21 July (51 days), China imported at least 8.1 million barrels of crude oil – 158,823 barrels per day (bpd) - from Iran in a number of relatively direct ways, a senior oil and gas industry source who works closely with Iran’s Petroleum Ministry exclusively told OilPrice.com. The vast majority of these 8.1 million barrels were delivered by crude oil container ship, beginning with the cargo of the ‘Giessel’.  “The Giessel likely loaded Iranian crude oil via ship-to-ship transfer just off the Strait of Hormuz at the Gulf of Oman and this likely occurred between the 26 April and 5 May,” sources at global energy markets intelligence company, Kpler, told OilPrice.com last week. “The Giessel then discharged about 2.1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil to [China’s state-owned] Sinopec at the Qingdao Huangdao port on 13 June,” added the Kpler sources.  Shortly thereafter, according to the Iran source, the crude oil tankers ‘Stream’ and ‘Snow’ left Iranian ports for China and later offloaded their respective 1.6 million barrels and 2.1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil at Chinese ports.  In addition to the near-159,000 bpd being exported directly, another 6.8 million barrels or so was exported over the same 51 day period (another 133,333 bpd) from Iran to China indirectly via Malaysia (and to a much lesser extent, Indonesia), according to highly-placed sources in Iran. This process involves shipping Iranian oil to somewhere within Malaysian (or Indonesian) maritime boundaries, changing the vessel registration documents relating to its origin and ownership, and to the provenance of the crude oil cargo, and then continuing the voyage on to China.   Related: Vitol Employees And Execs See Massive $2.2 Billion Payday A sign that this has been going on for many months, at least, appears in the official Chinese GAC crude oil import figures that show that for the January-June period of this year there was an 81.2 percent increase in China’s imports of crude oil from Malaysia, compared to the same period last year. Apparently attempting to obfuscate matters further, for the 13 June Giessel cargo to the Qingdao Huangdao port, internal Chinese Customs documents only refer to ‘a crude oil blend coming from Indonesia’ (not Malaysia).  The near-15 million barrels of crude oil exports from Iran to China over the 1 June to 21 July period (292,157 bpd) accounts for just over 58 per cent of all of Iran’s 500,000 bpd or so total current crude oil exports, out of a total current production of 2.2 million bpd, according to the Iran source.
 The fact that none of these have shown up in official GAC figures is entirely unsurprising, given the basic technical factor that any and all crude oil imports to China from Iran can be held in ‘bonded storage’. Put simply: crude oil that goes into ‘bonded storage’ is not put through Chinese Customs at all – and is not even recorded as having been ‘paid for’ - and consequently does not appear on any GAC documentation. This means that China can import as much Iranian oil as it wants without the oil appearing in any import figures and without, as far as the letter of the law is concerned, China breaking any U.S. sanctions. “Even if that wasn’t the standard procedure there, why would China record these deliveries anyway?” said the Iran source. Another method of Iran delivering its oil to China is now being worked on by Tehran, together with Russia and China itself. “This is to build-out the oil collection, storage, and delivery elements from Iran’s Caspian Sea allocation into the Russian feed-in structures used in the ESPO [Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean] pipeline, and then to move the Iranian crude through Kazakhstan and then into China,” the Iran source said. Iran now has an 11.875 per cent in the Caspian resource, with the onshore and offshore Caspian fields conservatively estimated to have around 48 billion barrels of oil in proved and probable reserves.  Russia already has experience of using Iranian oil in the ESPO crude oil blend. In 2018 it was facing numerous complaints from European buyers of its oil when its efforts to meet increased oil demand from China simply by boosting crude oil output in East Siberia failed. In order to redress the quality issue for Europe, Russia utilised the relevant light, sweet, Iran crude grade into its own ESPO deliveries, juggling it between Europe and China.  Related: Oil Prices Rise Despite An Influx Of OPEC+ Crude For China there are distinct advantages to holding millions of Iranian crude in storage, aside from the sanctions-busting element. To start with, it means that it can secure the oil at extremely discounted prices, in keeping with the secret element of the 25-year deal agreed between the two countries. In the case of the crude oil delivered by the Giessel, Stream, and Snow tankers – 5.8 million barrels in total – each barrel was discounted by US$10.95 to the headline Iranian grade price, according to the Iran source. “In addition to this discount, Iran offered China CIF [cost, insurance, and freight] cargoes at FOB [free-on-board] pricing, and Iran continues to offer Chinese buyers protection and indemnity [P&I] insurance, through the ‘Kish P&I Club’, among other such entities,” he added. Additionally positive for China is that this stored oil can be sold at any time should the need arise or at a time when oil prices rise significantly (effectively also functioning as a hedge). It can also be used for geopolitical advantage, as it allows China to trade the oil in deals with energy-poor countries that nonetheless have things (port facilities, for example) that China wants, especially in pursuit of its ‘One Belt, One Road’ programme. Finally, stored Iranian crude oil gives China a wider energy security safety net in the event that the U.S. imposes further sanctions against more of China’s traditional oil suppliers.  On the other side of the equation, Iran benefits in part from the fact that it does not have to halt production at its core fields because it is running out of storage space, which could damage the wells. Nor does it have to commit all of its tanker fleet to storage, which is costly and would prohibit revenue-raising crude oil exports to other countries. The major benefit for Iran, though, is funding. Before Iran signed the secret part of the 25-year deal with China it was short of the approximately US$150 billion that it needed to complete all of its major oil and gas developments, plus another US$250 billion that it needed to build out the rest of its key business sectors to internationally functioning levels. 
 Whilst China has vouched for this US$400 billion, Iran is still relatively cash poor, so the discounted oil exports are a means of allowing it to pay China for its part of the infrastructure development costs. According to various sources, the discounted price of oil on the Giessel, Stream, and Snow oil tankers, was part of the payment for Sinopec’s ongoing work on Phase 2 of Iran’s supergiant Yadavaran oil field. Sinopec is apparently working on this field on multiple contract-only operations through seven front companies that have been registered variously in Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, and Pakistan, OilPrice.com understands from the Iran source. In addition to the direct Iran to China tank crude oil shipments identified and the indirect Iran-Malaysia (occasional Indonesia)-China crude oil shipments from 1 June to 21 July, according to the Iran source: “Chinese shell companies took delivery of another 1.2 million barrels [23,529 bpd] of Iranian oil – re-labelled Iraqi crude - in June destined for China, and sold at a US$12 per barrel discount to the Basra blend price, and Pakistan commercial agents took an additional 1.1 million barrels [21,568 bpd] of crude oil purchased on behalf of China.”  This re-labelling of Iranian oil to Iraqi oil is as simple as it is undetectable by the U.S. Not only does Iraq share an extremely long and extremely porous border with Iran but the two countries share many oilfields, with the oil on the Iraqi side of the border being drilled from exactly the same reservoirs as the oil being drilled on the Iranian side. “Even if the Americans actually stationed people at every single rig in every single shared field in Iraq they wouldn’t be able to tell if the oil coming out it was from the Iraq side or the Iranian side,” said the Iran source.  In sum, these methods – direct shipping from Iran to China (around 159,000 bpd), indirect shipping from Iran to China via Malaysia or other countries’ waters (another 133,000 bpd), re-labelling for China export (24,000 bpd), and Pakistan commercial agents (22,000 bpd) – mean that over the 1 June to 21 July period alone, China imported at least 338,000 bpd of Iranian crude oil. This equates to just over 67 per cent of Iran’s total 500,000 bpd of exports at the moment. This leaves around 162,000 bpd being exported to Iran’s other major traditional buyers right now, including Syria and various former Eastern Bloc states, among others.",-0.9987,negative
US Shale Faces Another Round Of Bankruptcies.html,"More than thirty billion dollars: this is the size of the collective debt of oil and gas companies that filed for bankruptcy protection in the first half of the year. That is 23 companies, all but five of which filed during the second quarter when Covid-19 really took hold. Now, with the resurgence of new cases and an equal resurgence in doubts about the outlook for oil demand, more filings are on the way. “It is reasonable to expect that a substantial number of producers will continue to seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy even if oil prices recover over the next few months,” Haynes and Boone said in its June report on oil and gas bankruptcies. The reasons: lukewarm oil demand improvement and even more lukewarm economic improvement. Until economies return to normal, the law firm noted, the situation for oil and gas is unlikely to book any marked improvement. Yet within the industry, different segments have different degrees of vulnerability. Oilfield services, for instance, is the most vulnerable, as Westwood Global Energy Group noted in a recent report. Oilfield services are traditionally the most vulnerable because of their almost complete dependence on the upstream segment. When exploration and production slump, the companies actually providing these services suffer the most, as we saw during the last crisis. While the upstream segment also took a hard hit from the 2014-2016 oil price collapse, it was not as painful as it was for their services providers. The latter were forced to lower the prices of their services to survive, which in turn helped producers to limit their losses. Yet the upstream sector is in dire straits now, as well, especially in U.S. shale, Westwood Global Energy Group’s Head of Consulting, Arindam Das, noted in comments to Oilprice.com. According to Das, shale producers are the most vulnerable group within the oil and gas industry after oilfield service providers, along with smaller exploration and production companies in Western Canada. Remember those 30 billion dollars in debt accumulated by the companies that went bankrupt during the first half of the year? The exact figure is $30.62 billion, and it compares with $25.77 billion in accumulated debt for all the companies that went under throughout 2019. In the second quarter alone, the energy companies that filed for bankruptcy protection accumulated $29 billion in debt—again more than the figure for the entire last year. And banks are increasingly reluctant to do business with such a troubled industry.  Related: Asian LNG Prices Are Way To Low For U.S. Exporters
 Lenders started tightening their requirements for borrowers from the shale patch before the crisis, as many of them kept failing to hit their production targets despite the overall production boom. Now, with the outlook grimmer than it has been for a long time, they are tightening their lending requirements further, although, as Westwood’s Das notes, banks remain open to businesses with long-standing good names. Here again, oilfield services providers are in a weaker position than pretty much everyone else. Banks have been reducing their exposure to this segment of the industry for a while before the crisis struck, according to Das, and it seems they will continue doing that while they tighten their lending criteria for the sector players that are still their clients. Perhaps a consolidation could help the U.S. oil and gas industry get back on its feet, but so far, the only major deal that made headlines was Chevron’s acquisition of Noble Energy. Uncertainty is a big factor here. The future of the industry, especially the shale patch, is highly uncertain, and this may be dampening the appetite of private equity-backed companies that would have otherwise swooped in to pick up the tastiest morsels. This might change, according to Das. Private equity-backed buyers could yet decide to take advantage of the low oil price environment that is making a lot of assets cheap. If that happens, they will go after cash generative assets, Das noted, rather than assets in the early stages of development that would require a hefty investment to exploit. Indeed, this seems to be the prevailing sentiment in the industry. “We will be drilling wells again when oil is back in probably the $50 range,” David Hayes, partner at Natural Gas Partners, told the Midland Reporter-Telegram earlier this year. “It will be unconventional, and it will be horizontal, but it will be much more development-focused. Anything with even a whiff of exploration is not a near-term focus for capital, public or private.”
 Nobody, it seems, wants to risk too much, and this is understandable: the situation is unprecedented. “Since humans started using oil, we have never seen anything like this,” the chief economist of Trafigura, Saad Rahim, told the Wall Street Journal in April. “There is no guide we are following. This is uncharted.”  In such an environment, caution would be the name of the game for everyone—sellers and buyers, lenders, and shareholders.",-0.9939,negative
US Oil Production Wont Make A Comeback Under Current Prices.html,,0.0,neutral
Russian Oil Output Falls 16 In July.html,"Russian oil companies pumped 16 percent less oil last month than a year earlier, government data reported by Interfax showed. At 39.63 million tons, Russia’s average daily output for July was equal to 9.35 million bpd based on a conversion rate of 7.33 barrels per metric ton of oil. Reuters, however, cited Energy Ministry data that showed a daily average of 9.37 million barrels, which was slightly higher than the June average, which stood at 9.32 million bpd. The ministry commented that this rate of production was in line with Russia’s commitment to the OPEC+ production cut deal.
 Russia had one of the deepest production cut quotas in the OPEC+ group along with Saudi Arabia, at 2 million bpd. It took a while to achieve this level of output reduction, and starting from this month, it will increase the average daily output by some 400,000 bpd as the deepest cuts OPEC+ agreed in April expired at the end of July. According to the original agreement, OPEC+ was to cut 9.7 million bpd in combined production for two months—May and June—and then ease these to 7.7 million bpd, to stay in effect until the end of the year. Then, from January 2021, the production cuts would be further eased to 5.8 million bpd, to remain in effect until end-April 2022.
 While there has been speculation that the group may decide to extend the deepest cuts beyond the end of July, OPEC+ has stopped short of doing that even though international benchmark prices are still a lot lower than Middle Eastern producers are comfortable with. Prices fell today, too, as the market reacted to the start of production cut relaxation for most OPEC+ members, except laggards Iraq, Nigeria, and Angola, which failed to comply with their production quotas in the first couple of months of cuts.",0.6249,positive
Oil Prices Rise Despite An Influx Of OPEC Crude.html,"Oil prices jumped on Monday morning, recuperating earlier losses, on the first trading day after OPEC+ eased its record oil production cuts by 2 million barrels per day (bpd), while surging COVID-19 cases have dampened the optimism for a swift oil demand recovery. As of 10:57 a.m. EDT on Monday, WTI Crude was up 1.14 percent at $40.73 and Brent Crude up 0.64 percent at $43.80. The easing of the 9.7-million-bpd production cuts of the OPEC+ group to a 7.7-million-bpd cut as of August 1 is weighing on market sentiment, even though OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia has said that it would keep its oil exports in August at the same level as in July, confirming earlier reports that it would not be rushing to boost supply to the market.
 According to the monthly Reuters survey published on Friday, production at OPEC soared in July, after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait ended their collective voluntary one-month additional cuts after June. As per the Reuters survey, OPEC’s production averaged 23.32 million bpd in July, up by 970,000 bpd compared to June, which saw the lowest OPEC oil output since 1991. The three Arab Gulf allies pumped oil just below their quotas in July, compared to a collective additional 1-million-bpd cut in June. The laggards in compliance in all previous months and all previous deals – Iraq and Nigeria – didn’t make much progress on moving toward higher compliance, according to the Reuters survey. The timing of OPEC+ relaxing the cuts coincides with growing concerns that resurging coronavirus cases in many parts of the world, including in the world’s top petroleum consumer, the United States, could stall the oil demand recovery.
 “Speculators appear to be getting more nervous about the demand recovery, with the path much more gradual than market expectations coming into the second half of the year,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Monday. “This stall in demand comes at a time when the market is already starting to see supply coming back,” they said.

Asian LNG Prices Are Way To Low For US Exporters.html,"A massive wave of investment has poured into LNG export terminals around the world in recent years, and nearly all of the projects have China at the center of their business plans. While China has been the largest source of LNG demand growth for quite some time, and will likely remain a key buyer going forward, Chinese demand may not be large enough for all of the LNG projects on the drawing board. More than a few LNG projects face investment risks as China balks at prices needed for many export terminals to make sense, according to a new report.  The LNG market went into a tailspin this year due to the pandemic, but in reality, the global market for natural gas was heading into a downturn at the start of 2020, before the coronavirus led to widespread shutdowns. A substantial increase in export capacity in 2019 outpaced demand growth, pushing down prices. Against a weak backdrop, the pandemic-related demand destruction knee-capped the market, leading to LNG prices in Asia (JKM) to collapse below $3/MMBtu and even below $2/MMBtu for a period of time.  LNG has been the worst-performing commodity during the pandemic, trailing even crude oil and coal.  The pain of the LNG supply glut has been felt most acutely by U.S. exporters. The gas glut in Asia led to storage filling up in Europe, and ultimately the flexibility of American LNG translated into cancelled cargoes from the United States. Dozens of cargoes were cancelled in each of June, July and August.  Still, JKM prices have edged up and fewer U.S. cargoes are slated to be cancelled for September, perhaps a sign that the worst is over.  But hopes of a rebound in global LNG markets should be tempered. In the long-term, China may not absorb all of the gas that LNG developers expect. “A China-led rebound for the U.S. LNG industry will face stiff price resistance from Chinese buyers,” according to a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The report did a deep dive into the Chinese market, and the authors found that Chinese importers were losing money on imported LNG. For example, PetroChina lost money on importing LNG every year between 2015 and 2019. The IEEFA analysis is not based on trade war concerns, but instead only focuses on the internal market in China. 
 China has expanding gas connections via pipeline from Central Asia, ample coal and renewable capacity, and it also has infrastructure constraints that prevents imported LNG from serving all parts of the domestic market. This limits the “long-term upside for a U.S. LNG boom,” wrote Clark Williams-Derry and Ghee Peh, authors of the IEEFA report.  Any expansion in LNG imports going forward would need to be done on the basis of import prices below $7/MMBtu. Anything above that threshold may not work out financially for Chinese companies, IEEFA found.  Related: Economic Turmoil Leaves Oil Trapped At $40 But here’s the problem. $7/MMBtu is likely to be too low for U.S. LNG exporters. The cost for LNG to arrive in Asia requires somewhere around $2/MMBtu for Henry Hub gas, plus $3/MMBtu for liquefaction, plus another $1/MMBtu for transportation. That means it roughly costs $6/MMBtu at a minimum to ship gas to Asia.  Complicating that equation is that Henry Hub is at unusually low levels, and certainly at unsustainably low levels if U.S. shale gas drillers ever want to make any money. So, Henry Hub will likely need to rise above $2/MMBtu. For instance, Goldman Sachs has repeatedly forecast U.S. natural gas prices in 2021 will exceed $3/MMBtu. On top of that, any increase in shipping costs would further negatively impact the equation.  That means that American gas may need to fetch well above $7/MMBtu in the long run if the trade is to be profitable. “Given recent U.S. gas feedstock and shipping costs, U.S. LNG imports barely price into the Chinese gas markets; and even modest increases in gas or shipping costs could render U.S. LNG imports entirely uneconomic,” the authors wrote.
 These pricing dynamics don’t necessarily apply to existing facilities with contracts and sunk costs. But any new U.S. LNG export facility now faces significant investment risk. Indeed, new facilities are generally not built on spec; they require buyers to sign on before the FID is made. As a result, new U.S. LNG projects may not go forward.   A separate report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES) recently came to a similar conclusion. OIES said that because of the glut, buyers would balk at signing long-term contracts with rigid terms. “It is therefore clearly relevant to ask whether we should expect to see any new US LNG investment decisions being taken in the foreseeable future, especially with buyers not rushing to sign new long-term contracts,” OIES wrote in a July report. Many scenarios for American gas exporters bake in the assumption of an inexorable and unstoppable rise in Chinese gas demand – something along the lines of “if we build it, they will come.”  But “[b]ullish demand projections for LNG demand in China and Southeast Asia tend to ignore the price sensitivity of these markets, as well as the many logistical, economic, and political obstacles to the development of LNG and gas infrastructure,” the IEEFA analysts said. “The most optimistic LNG demand scenarios are simply unrecognizable to experienced analysts of the Chinese energy sector.” ",-0.9833,negative
Why Energy Demand Is Plummeting In The US.html,"All the way back in April (which may as well be years ago at the rate that the news cycle is moving these days) Oilprice reported that in the throes of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which had relatively recently washed over the United States, had caused the nation’s energy consumption to fall to a stunning 16-year low.  According to NPR’s Planet Money podcast, which reported on this statistic at the time, this was a figure that was a particularly good indicator of just how badly the domestic economy was doing. ““How much electricity the country uses tends to match how much the economy is growing or shrinking really closely,” said Cardiff Garcia, one of the show’s hosts, on the April 13 Indicator podcast. “It can tell us how much worse the economy is getting in real-time, and it should also tell us when the economy has started to recover.”  But now, as it turns out, a 16-year low was nothing. No big whoop. Chump change. This week, Fox Business, in a collaborative report with the Associated Press reported that the United States’ nationwide energy consumption  actually dipped to an incredible more-than 30-year low earlier this year. “The drop was driven by less demand for coal that is burned for electricity and oil that’s refined into gasoline and jet fuel, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said,” as paraphrased by Fox Business. “That’s the lowest monthly level since 1989 and the largest decrease ever recorded in data that’s been collected since 1973.” Prior to the economic devastation and drop in energy demand wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the largest drop in United States history was recorded in December 2001, “after the Sept. 11 attacks shocked the economy and a mild winter depressed electricity demand”.
  Related: Economic Turmoil Leaves Oil Trapped At $40 The quantity of electricity consumed what’s not the only energy metric that saw drastic change this spring; the way that people used energy also saw a huge transformation. “In South Korea, Italy, and Seattle telework and residential internet usage have soared 40% in just weeks,” tallied a Forbes report released toward the beginning of the pandemic in February. “In France 80% of internet traffic is now Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix, and providers are pledging to ensure ‘digital discipline.’”  While telecommuting is not a new invention, and a full 24 percent of the U.S. workforce worked from home in the last year, “coronavirus isolation has already boosted that, and could be a watershed event for digital connecting,” Forbes wrote. As Oilprice reported at the time, “these new legions of telecommuters, their tablet-happy toddlers, and kids adjusting to attending school online are eating up huge amounts of bandwidth. This translates to a lot of families around the world ponying up a lot of money for their internet package and electricity bills as we head into what is certain to be a particularly brutal recession.”
 And that’s just one half of an equation, and the other side isn’t looking great either. While business owners are celebrating having the cost of keeping the lights on taken off their hands, “After the virus clears and we’re left with a recession, landlords may have a hard time convincing corporate tenants to keep paying pricey overhead for employees who still got the work done, remotely,” says Forbes. “It can cost $20,000, according to JLL, to kit out the average 150 square feet of office space per worker. And, depending on your city, $300 or more per employee per month for rent, plus $50 per employee per month in supplies and snacks, and $20 per month to keep the lights on, air-conditioned and computers charged.” But no matter who is footing the bill, the energy industry is losing out in the end. Energy demand is down--WAY down--and it’s taking hundreds of thousands of jobs along with it. Of course, energy demand will inevitably rebound, but the question is whether the source of energy will look the same in the future. While death knells are sounding for global coal and U.S. shale, many world leaders, from both the public and private sector, are pushing for investment into green energy as the more stable energy sector of the future. ",0.1551,positive
Canadian Oil Drilling Forecast Gets Slashed Again.html,"Some 2,800 new wells will be drilled in Canada this year, according to the Petroleum Services Association of the country. This is the third downward revision the PSAC has made so far this year amid the continuing oil price crisis. Its previous revision was to a 50-year low of 3,100 wells, the Canadian Press reports. Last year, Canadian oil and gas companies drilled 4,900 wells. That was despite the low prices for Canadian oil resulting from a shortage of pipeline capacity and the global glut. Oil prices are certainly a factor in the businesses’ decision to drill fewer wells this year, but it is not the only one. A slow recovery of the wider economy and high debt levels among oil and gas drillers are also at play, according to the interim chief executive of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, Elizabeth Aquin.
 Interestingly, just a day earlier, IHS Markit forecast that oil sands production in Canada was set to grow despite the adverse effects of the pandemic on the energy industry. “The impact of COVID19 has changed the driver of the lower investment period, not necessarily the direction of long-term expectations,” two senior IHS Markit analysts noted, saying they expected oil sands output to reach 3.8 million bpd in 2030, just 100,000 bpd less than pre-crisis projections. In more positive signs for the industry, earlier this month, reports emerged that Canadian oil and gas producers were bringing back curtailed output. According to Bloomberg, about a fifth of the 1 million bpd in shut-in production was being brought back as oil prices recovered from the multi-year lows seen in April.
 “Nobody should be surprised to see our production moving back to full production capacity. We are significantly cash-flow positive at the levels we’re at now,” said the chief executive of oil sands major Cenovus.",0.9581,positive

The Cowboy State Looks To Stimulate Oil Drilling With Tax Cuts.html,"Wyoming regulators look to stimulate oil production in the state with a new tax relief proposal that calls for a tax exemption until the price of WTI reaches $45 per barrel The Wyoming legislature’s Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee has sponsored a bill proposing tax relief for oil and gas companies in a bid to stimulate an increase in production. The bill calls for a tax exemption once the price of West Texas Intermediate reaches $45 per barrel for light sweet crude and $38 per barrel for sour grades produced in the state.
 While the tax exemption will only be temporary, to be in effect no longer than 12 months after the benchmark price of oil reaches the necessary threshold, its sponsors believe it could have a positive effect on the oil and gas industry in Wyoming. “We’re recognizing that if [the] price is too low, companies are not going to come back anyway. So, we’re gonna set it at maybe a break-even to get a company over the hump to choose Wyoming over North Dakota, to choose Wyoming over New Mexico,” said the president of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, Pete Obermueller, as quoted by Wyoming Public Media. While not the biggest producer in the United States, Wyoming did pump 102.1 million barrels of crude last year. That was up from 87.9 million barrels a year earlier, according to the Wyoming State Geological Survey. And yet the price collapse has severely affected production in the state: a year ago, there were 37 drilling rigs in Wyoming. To date, there is just one.
 One of the oldest oil-producing regions in the United States, three years ago Wyoming grabbed headlines with its Powder River Basin—a legacy producing region that was attracting a lot of oil and gas investment thanks to low land prices and the recovery in the prices of oil. At the time, some expected the Powder River Basin to become something like a new Permian. This has not happened, but tax relief would certainly motivate drillers to expand once the price becomes right.",0.9538,positive
Oil Rallies On Biggest Crude Inventory Draw Since 2019.html,"U.S. crude oil inventories shed an impressive 10.6 million barrels in the week to July 24, the Energy Information Administration reported today. This compares with a build of 4.9 million barrels for the previous week. However, inventories remain 17 percent above the five-year seasonal average. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute reported an estimated crude oil inventory decline of 6.83 million barrels, versus analyst expectations of a much more modest draw of 357,000 barrels. A surge in new Covid-19 infections in the United States offset the oil price gains that followed the API’s report and now the figures that the EIA has reported will likely help prices recoup some of those losses.
 As the global oil demand outlook remains mostly negative since the coronavirus is resurging not just in the United States but in other countries as well, optimism about the oil industry—especially the downstream segment—is on the wane. The EIA’s inventory report may help change that. In gasoline, the authority estimated a 700,000-barrel inventory build for the week to July 24, compared with a 1.8-million-barrel draw a week earlier. The EIA also said refineries churned out an average of 9.2 million bpd of gasoline last week, compared with 9.1 million bpd a week earlier. In distillate fuels, the EIA reported an inventory increase of half a million barrels, compared with a 1.1-million-barrel inventory build for the previous week. Distillate fuel production, the EIA said, averaged 4.8 million bpd last week, slightly up on the previous week.
 At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $43.70 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $41.37 a barrel, both slightly up from yesterday’s close. The $40-43 range has proved quite resilient over the past couple of weeks, not least because of the global economy outlook amid the pandemic, which remains overwhelmingly pessimistic, with expectations for slower rather than quicker recovery around the world, notably in the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer.",0.6369,positive
US Refiners Brace For Ugliest Losses In A Decade.html,"Due to the demand crash in the lockdown, the seven largest independent oil refiners in the United States are expected to report losses for the second quarter that would be the worst Q2 quarterly figures in the refining industry in a decade, Reuters estimates of analyst forecasts show. The earnings reporting season for U.S. refiners begins on Thursday, with Valero Energy expected to report a loss per share of $1.41, versus earnings per share of $1.51 for the second quarter of 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. For the first quarter, Valero had already reported a net loss of $1.9 billion, compared to a profit for the same period last year, after it took a $2-billion hit in the value of its inventory.
 “It’s been a very challenging start to the year with significant impacts to families, communities and businesses world-wide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Joe Gorder, Valero’s chairman and CEO said, commenting on the Q1 results. According to analyst expectations, the Q2 figures could be equally dismal, not only for Valero but for the other top independent refiners. In the second quarter, oil demand crashed as most of the United States was under lockdown with people staying home or not traveling far. As a result, inventory of refined oil products was rising, and so was the U.S. commercial crude oil stockpile. Refiners drastically cut crude oil inputs and processing rates in April and May, and refining margins were bleak.
 Some refiners idled refineries as demand was very weak. Marathon Petroleum, for instance, idled its Martinez refinery in California. Refiners with more exposure to California and the West Coast are facing very weak refining margins because of the resurgence of coronavirus cases in California, analysts told Reuters. Overall, crude oil inputs at American refiners are still down 16.6 percent from year-ago levels, at 14.206 million bpd for the week to July 17, as per EIA data. Refinery utilization was at 77.9 percent for the week to July 17, compared to 93.1 percent for the same week last year. ",-0.9793,negative
Oil Buyers Profit From A Wave Of Cheap Fuel.html,"The downstream industry has been affected particularly severely by the unique combination of events that unfolded this year. On the one hand, the coronavirus pandemic decimated demand for their products, and on the other, OPEC+ reduced production, raising prices. What is more, refined oil products have stayed off oil buyers’ radar. Refiners just got a tiny respite from oil buyers, though, according to Reuters’ John Kemp. He noted in his latest column that hedge funds and other institutional oil buyers had turned their sights towards fuels last week, buying some 20 million barrels of U.S. gasoline and diesel, and European gasoil.  Unfortunately, this respite is nowhere near enough to make refiners’ lives better. New flares of infection around the world have prompted several countries to reintroduce travel restriction measures just weeks after they were lifted, spelling trouble for transport demand.  And whatever spells trouble for transport spells double trouble for refiners. The danger of a second wave has already weighed on crude oil prices. Ordinarily, this would be a positive development for refiners, but the tables have turned now that low prices are coming from expectations of lower demand for refined products. The silver lining, such as it is, is that a second wave of infections may not affect oil demand as much as the first one did—at least according to Rystad Energy.
 At the same time, different fuels are recovering differently in terms of demand. Gasoline demand, for instance, has shown some signs of recovery after lockdowns were lifted around the world. This recovery, however, has been moving unevenly. The Energy Information Administration has been reporting both inventory builds and draws in gasoline stockpiles over the weeks following the lifting of lockdowns, noting these are still above the five-year average for the season.  Related: Oil Markets Face New Glut As OPEC Prepares To Open The Taps Distillate fuels have been slower to recover, chiefly because of the decimated demand for air travel and hence jet fuel, for which distillates serve as feedstock. In fact, in many cases, refiners were forced to use the distillates that are typically turned into jet fuel into diesel fuel, pushing up diesel inventories while demand remained weak. The outlook for jet fuel is bleak. 
 Analysts from Bank of America said earlier this week that they did not expect jet fuel demand to fully recover until 2023. According to the BofA analysts, the third quarter of next year will be the first signs of jet fuel demand rebound. It will then take another two years for it to reach pre-crisis levels of 8 million bpd—if ever—because while they wait for demand for air travel to recover, some airlines could go under. In more bad news for the refining industry, the world’s largest oil importer, which reported record run rates after the end of the lockdown in China, is now cutting these run rates because of a fuel glut. This glut would likely have happened even without a pandemic: Chinese refiners have been adding refining capacity too quickly, saturating the Asian market and affecting refinery margins. All in all, refiners need all the help they can get right now. They are unlikely to get it, however, as the world hunkers down in preparation for a second wave of Covid-19. This second wave will likely delay further the rebound in oil demand and in transport, which would, in turn, delay the rebound in refining margins, putting some refineries out of business. Nevertheless, according to Wood Mackenzie analysts, over the long term, the downstream sector will require investments in new capacity, at least in some regions such as Asia and the Middle East, where demand for oil is expected to grow. It seems the near to medium term is problematic, but the long-term outlook for the downstream sector is quite positive.",-0.9854,negative
Record Volumes Of Cheap US Crude Oil Are Headed To Asia.html,"A record volume of U.S. crude oil is set to arrive in China and the rest of Asia this month as buyers rushed to snap up cheap oil earlier this year, Refinitiv’s tanker-tracking and port data showed. According to Reuters columnist Clyde Russell, the most likely reason for the all-time high Asian imports of crude from America is the cheap oil prices in March and April, when oil prices were half what they are today. The cargoes bought in March, April, and May are set to arrive in July and August, so it is no surprise that Asia’s imports of U.S. crude oil are set to smash records this month.
 According to Refinitiv data, Asia as a whole is expected to import a record 1.86 million barrels per day (bpd) of American oil this month, compared to the previous record of 1.36 million bpd imported in October 2019. Among Asian buyers, China is leading the way, after its oil refiners rushed to buy ultra-cheap spot cargoes in April, taking advantage of the deep discounts at which many crude grades were being offered to China with non-existent demand elsewhere.  China is expected to import around 1.1 million bpd of U.S. crude oil in July, according to Refinitiv estimates. This would be more than double the previous record of Chinese imports from the U.S. of 466,000 bpd in June 2018, just before the two biggest economies started the trade war.
 The high imports of U.S. crude oil in Asia are likely to continue in August until all cheap cargoes arrive, but after that, nominations seem to have dropped off, as oil prices rose. Despite the expected record imports of U.S. crude in July, China is nowhere near achieving its target for energy purchases from the United States under the Phase 1 trade deal, and with oil prices double compared to April and demand still weak in Asia, the Chinese buying spree – including of U.S. oil – may be coming to an end.

Oil Markets Face New Glut As OPEC Prepares To Open The Taps.html,"The upcoming partial return of curtailed OPEC+ oil production from August is set to create a new four-month supply glut of around 170 million barrels, a Rystad Energy analysis reveals. The analysis is based on the assumption that oil demand will not rebound as quickly as previously thought due to the persistent expansion of the Covid-19 pandemic in key markets, or what we call a mild second wave of the virus. After the first five months of 2020, which all registered excess global oil production compared to market demand, June was a month when global stocks saw some relief of 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of implied oil inventory draws. July, the last month of OPEC+’s record 9.7 million bpd output curtailment commitment, is also set to end with demand surprisingly exceeding supply by 1.9 million bpd. But with the mild second wave already hitting several countries, we scale back our total liquids (crude, condensate, NGLs, other liquids, and refinery gains) demand recovery expectations in the short-term. Between August and October, total liquids demand levels will stay flat at around 90.5 million bpd, before rising to 92.9 million bpd in November and 94.6 million bpd in December. Unlike demand, global oil supply is set for a mini growth rally after reaching an astonishing low of 86.4 million bpd in June and an expected 88.2 million bpd in July. The planned output increase from the OPEC+ alliance and the reactivation of other global shut-in production is forecast to push supply to 91.2 million bpd in August, 92.5 million bpd in September, 92.9 million bpd in October and 93.3 million bpd in November, before closing at 93.4 million bpd in December.
 “OPEC’s experiment to increase production from August could backfire as we are still nowhere near out of the woods yet in terms of oil demand. The overall liquids market will flip back into a mini-supply glut and a swing into deficit will not happen again until December 2020,” says Bjornar Tonhaugen, Rystad Energy’s Head of Oil Market Research.  Nevertheless, the total surplus of about 170 million oil barrels that will be created between August and November is only a fraction of the 1.4 billion-barrel stock overhang that was built up in the first five months of 2020. This historic inventory build-up will still act as a soft brake on price increases when demand rebounds.  Related: China Signs Series Of Deals To Develop Supergiant Oilfield In Iran On the supply side, the US provided a much-needed supply-side buoy. We made major revisions to both our historical and future output projections. Based on preliminary reporting from most of the big oil-producing states and satellite data that give us insights into frac activity, we now believe that oil production (crude and condensate) reached a bottom of 10.4 million bpd in May 2020.
 While oil production in the US will rise from now and until September, we have revised down our growth expectations due to low frac activity and natural decline. Production is estimated to bounce back toward the 11 million to 11.2 million bpd range and then degrade towards 10.7 million bpd again in 4Q20 and 1Q21 as the current activity level is insufficient to offset the natural base decline. In addition, we revised down Iraqi oil production by about 200,000 bpd as the country makes good on its promise to make up for past missed OPEC+ compliance. Country-wide production will drop to 3.8 million bpd in Jul-20, we forecast, compared to our initial view that its output would struggle to get below the 4 million bpd barrier. We expect to see Iraq oil production capped below 4 million bpd through October but then will see output gradually increase again. “We doubt that the market can take the additional production volumes from OPEC+ from August without negative consequences for oil prices, as the new glut will likely cancel some of the gains that led Brent to post Covid-19 highs of about $44 this month,“ Tonhaugen concludes. Our balances suggest that OPEC+’ tapering plans to year-end may need to be put on hold if the goal is to sustain the oil price recovery. This can of course still happen, perhaps already in a month, as OPEC’s market monitoring committee will be reassessing the market on a monthly basis.",0.193,positive
OPEC May Have To Adapt To Lower For Longer Oil Demand.html,"OPEC is trying to come to terms with the idea that the coronavirus crisis may have brought with it permanent changes in consumer behavior, stifling oil demand over the next two decades in stark contrast to the demand that the cartel had expected just a year ago.   Some officials at OPEC are admitting the possibility – unthinkable until just six months ago – that global oil demand may not recover to the pre-pandemic levels, ever, OPEC officials and industry sources close to the cartel told Reuters’ Alex Lawler. In the wake of the demand destruction in the pandemic, OPEC now faces a new long-term conundrum on top of its short-term mission to manage oil supply during the crisis. This new problem for the cartel is how to make the most of its oil and get the most revenues for it in a world in which oil demand growth could be much slower than anticipated, or zero.  
 A key concern at OPEC is whether the COVID-19 crisis has significantly accelerated the timeline of peak oil demand, or whether we are already past that peak, according to OPEC officials and sources close to OPEC who spoke to Reuters. Some of the top executives in the industry, including Shell and BP’s CEOs, are not committing to predictions, but they admitted earlier this year that we don’t know what lies beyond this crisis. They also admit that oil demand might have peaked. “[E]nergy demand and certainly mobility demand will be lower even when this crisis more or less [is] behind us. Will it mean that it will never recover? It’s probably too early to say. But it will have a permanent knock for years,” Shell’s chief executive Ben van Beurden told IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin in an interview earlier this month.
 BP’s chief executive Bernard Looney is not ruling out either that the oil demand crash and perhaps the subsequent lasting change in people’s lifestyle may have already brought about peak oil demand.   OPEC, as usual, is not publicly expressing any worries about ‘peak oil demand.’ Yet, if there is a lasting change in demand patterns after the crisis, the cartel and its members – many of which rely heavily on oil revenues for budget income – may be in for many behind-closed-doors meetings and brainstorming sessions about what to do next.

China Signs Series Of Deals To Develop Supergiant Oilfield In Iran.html,"Two key questions logically arise from last week’s announcement from Iran’s Petroleum Ministry that it has awarded a US$1.3 billion development deal to more than double oil production at the supergiant South Azadegan oilfield, the second such oil project signed this month, the other being a US$300 million development contract for Yaran. The first question is, given the fact that Iran is technically bankrupt, how can it afford such projects? The second is, given the swingeing U.S. sanctions still in place – including against the main tanker fleets of the National Iranian Tanker Company and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line – where is any of this increased oil supply meant to go? The answer to both questions is the same – China – and precisely what is going on is analysed below. Firstly, Iran’s finances are arguably the worst they have ever been, due to the U.S.’s re-imposition of sanctions in 2018, following its unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in May of that year. Using a comparison benchmark of November 2019, as of a week ago, Iran’s GDP growth is minus 22 percent, unemployment is around 37 per cent, inflation is over 65 per cent, and the rial has depreciated at least 65 percent to date over that period against a basket of core global currencies. Iran is also currently running a budget deficit of 80 per cent, and a trade balance of negative US$6.5 billion.  With little prospect of the U.S. lifting its sanctions against Iran any time soon, and any country that uses the U.S. dollar significantly in the trade transactions of itself or its corporations having little choice but to abide by these sanctions, it can well be argued that Iran had little choice but to go with where the money is, which is China. Consequently, as uncovered by OilPrice.com, Iran last year signed a 25-year deal with China that publically just reiterated the key elements of a very vague co-operation deal that was agreed in 2016 but privately included a collection of highly-specific deals across many business sectors, most notably including oil and gas.   Related: Oil Drops As Demand Recovery Stalls Aside from the new military element added in recently – also uncovered by OilPrice.com - the oil and gas industry part of the 25-year deal means that in exchange for at least US$400 billion from China, Chinese companies will be given the first option to bid on any new – or uncompleted – oil, gas, and petrochemicals projects in Iran. China will also be able to buy any and all oil, gas, and petchems products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12 per cent to the six-month rolling mean average price of comparable benchmark products, plus another 6 to 8 percent of that metric for risk-adjusted compensation. Additionally, China will be able to pay in soft currencies accrued from doing business in Africa and Former Soviet Union states. Given the exchange rates involved, China is looking at another 8 to 12 percent discount, which means a total discount of around 32 per cent for China on all oil, gas, and petchems purchases. With this deal now exposed, the two countries are constrained in being able to just roll-out the pieces of deal with impunity. Aside from the public reaction on the ground in Iran, Tehran is concerned about an even harsher backlash from the U.S., either more sanctions, or less tangential measures. China, meanwhile, is not only in the midst of the ongoing Trade War with the U.S. but is also having to deal with the fallout of a range of corollary issues now springing up from Washington. Most recently these include the U.S.’s sanctioning of China over its alleged human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and the extension of U.S. sanctions against China’s flagship technology company, Huawei, over cyber-espionage and technology theft concerns. 
 “It’s one thing for China to ignore all sanctions that the U.S. has imposed on importing Iranian oil and gas, but it’s quite another thing for it to blatantly put its major state companies on the ground in Iran right now, when tensions are so high,” a senior oil and gas industry source who works closely with Iran’s Petroleum Ministry told OilPrice.com last week. “The working template for such deals to go ahead with Chinese companies without attracting too much attention from either the Iranian public or the U.S. State Department is for Iran to begin by making a field development award to a plausible-sounding Iranian development firm [in South Azadegan’s case the US$1.3 billion contract was awarded to Iran’s Petropars, and in Yaran’s case the US$300 million contract was given to Iran’s Persia Oil and Gas Industry Development Co.],” the source said.   Related: Oil Prices In Limbo As Fears Of A Second COVID Wave Grow “Then the Iranian firm quietly awards a series of very dull-sounding ‘contract-only’ projects to a number of firms virtually no one has heard of – but all controlled by the big Chinese firms - and China is back in business as the de facto developer,” he added. “Exactly the same method has been used by China recently to expand into Iraq’s Majnoon field and into its West Qurna-1 field,” he underlined. In precisely this context, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) subsidiary, China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corp (CPECC), was awarded a US$121 million engineering contract late last year for West-Qurna-1. Just before that, China’s Hilong Oil Service & Engineering Company was awarded a US$54 million to drill 80 wells in Majnoon (although China also financed the US$255 million contract awarded to the Iraq Drilling Company at the same time). Crucially, Majnoon is Iraq’s side of the reservoir it shares with Iran, where it is called Azadegan (South and North).  In line with this strategy, then, various Chinese companies have been awarded 11 ‘contract-only’ projects in a number of operational areas of Iran’s South Azadegan oil field development, the Iran source exclusively told OilPrice.com. These include contracts for drilling-only, field maintenance-only, engineering-only, construction-only, and technology-only, among others. A further pointer to what is really going on with South Azadegan is that Petropars was also the partner to CNPC in the stalled Phase 11 project of the supergiant South Pars non-associated natural gas field. 
 “When [France’s] Total dropped out of Phase 11, CNPC was persuaded to add Total’s stake [50.1 percent] to its own stake [30 percent] by Iran’s additional promise that it [CNPC or another Chinese firm] would also get the first rights to take the major foreign rights to develop the South Azadegan field,” he said. “In Phase 11’s case, Petropars was the main Iranian representative company, with a 19.9 per cent stake and in South Azadegan it is now supposedly the principal developer,” he added. “In reality, it doesn’t make any difference what name is on the publicly-available contract, China is just going ahead with what has already been agreed,” he underlined.  With an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil in place in South Azadegan, the new deal is designed to increase its production from the current 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 320,000 bpd over 30 months, according to the Petroleum Ministry. As part of the 25-year deal, any and all part of this output can be required by Beijing to go to China, although the understanding is that Iran can take sufficient output from its oil and gas fields for its own power needs (and to maintain the energy supply deal to Iraq until such time as the U.S. ends the waiver for that). To do this, Iran and China have a very long-established number of methods to not make it too obvious to the U.S. ",0.827,positive
How One Oil Major Excelled As Prices Crashed.html,"When oil prices plunged to historic lows in April, the majority of oil producers, including OPEC+ nations, responded by drastically cutting production to get rid of the huge supply overhang. However, one oil company responded by doing just the opposite: Ramping up production and storing the excess oil in anticipation of a market rebound. Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor ASA (NYSE: EQNR) is one of a handful of oil companies that have managed to turn a profit in this tumultuous market after its oil storage bet paid off big time. Equinor has reported a surprise adjusted net income of $646M for the second quarter, trouncing Wall Street’s expectations for a loss of $250M thanks to huge trading profits despite a huge 53 percent plunge in revenue to $8.04B. Equinor’s marketing division delivered record-high results, with Q2 adjusted earnings for the company’s marketing, midstream, and processing division clocking in at $696M vs. just $74M a year ago. Interestingly, Equinor also set itself apart from its European peers by maintaining its long-term crude oil price forecasts, thus avoiding a potentially huge impairment. The state-controlled oil company maintained its earlier forecast of $80 crude oil in 2030. Contango Play  Source: Statista
 Equinor’s impressive quarter can be squarely chalked up to the perfect execution of the so-called contango oil plays. When oil prices tanked in April, the price difference between a Brent contract for six-month forward contract and one for immediate delivery - a key measure of the degree of contango - plunged to a record of nearly -$14 a barrel, surpassing the last major contango witnessed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.   Related: Oil Prices In Limbo As Fears Of A Second COVID Wave Grow Equinor pounced on the opportunity and started storing millions of barrels of the commodity, filling its oil tankers with crude, turning them into floating storage facilities, and renting onshore storage elsewhere. The company did this in anticipation that it would be able to flip its oil inventory at a profit when prices later recovered in the famous contango play. And recover they did. After averaging a multi-year low of $18.38/barrel in April, Brent prices have staged a significant recovery, averaging $29.38 in May and later crossing and holding above the $40/barrel mark in late June. Equinor took advantage of the oil price bounce to sell its inventories, which, combined with other oil trading activity, helped deliver a record of about $1.16 billion in pre-tax adjusted earnings in just a single quarter. 
 “The increase was mainly due to the contango market during the quarter and good results from liquids trading,” the company said during its latest earnings report. Equinor was hardly a lone player in the contango game. Savvy oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) as well as trading houses such as Glencore, Vitol, and Trafigura made a killing during the oil price crash. Meanwhile, Reuters reported in June that Goldman Sachs commodities trading unit booked more than $1B in trading revenues after it correctly predicted the collapse and positioned its desks accordingly. BP Plc (NYSE: BP), Total SA (NYSE: TOT) Eni SpA, and Lukoil PJSC also have large trading desks whose profits might help offset losses from low oil prices. Obviously, a key component of a successful contango play is access to ample storage. Luckily, Equinor was well endowed in that department, with its Mongstad, Eldar Saetre underground caverns capable of holding nearly 9.5 million barrels. The company also said it had rented storage capacity in Korea for years and also used floating storage extensively. Unfortunately, lack of storage space is the key reason why prices dipped into negative territory in April - and the reason why many other traders were locked out of the juicy contango profits.",0.9443,positive
Microsoft And Halliburton Are Building The Oilfield Of The Future.html,"The oilfield has historically been a place where brawny men, and mighty machines came together to bore holes deeply into the earth to wrest stores of oil and gas from the depths. This model, which developed over many decades of exploration and production activity carried huge costs, particularly as the focus of this activity moved into more and more inaccessible regions. The current oil crash and resultant industry consolidation, began in 2014, and continues to this day. Downturns are nothing new to this industry. The difference this time is the longevity and severity of this downturn has kept any real recovery from taking place in the broader industry. Companies have been forced into retrenchment after retrenchment in both the operating and service industry.   Rystad  As the Rystad graphic above illustrates, capital has fled the E&P sector, due in large part to uncertainties about oil and gas prices and a shift toward renewable forms of energy. Energy giant, Halliburton, (NYSE: HAL) reported results last week, and largely surprised analysts with their ability to cut costs and generate Free Cash Flow, in a constantly shrinking market. What escaped much notice in the conference call after the earnings release, was the direction that Halliburton CEO, Jeff Miller sees shaping up for the oilfield of the future. In this article we will take a look at some of the key manifestations of this change. A smaller industry footprint to producing increasing amounts of oil and gas Miller pointed out in the call that the cuts are permanent reductions in employee count and facilities infrastructure. “Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. The growth in digital technologies, the position of strength in the returns for our shareholders. We believe that the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery.”  Related: Oil Prices Stuck At $40 Source To fully understand the implication of Miller’s comments it is important to combine the reduction in capex supplied to the industry with the continuing need for oil and gas well into this century.  EIA This graphic from the EIA shows that global energy growth to mid-century and beyond, will primarily derive from continued production of oil and gas.
  The story of how companies like Halliburton will achieve these energy production goals, while at the same time having less and less money and resources to employ in this effort is the focus of the rest of this article. Technology seems to gravitate to the oilfield. Doing more with less has always been in the background as the industry responded to ever increasing markets with large explosions of capex. Those days are gone as we have noted, and increasingly what would have been big capex solutions are moving to smarter, more flexible components that deliver value while packing in profits to the supplier. You will also see more joint ventures with participants each bring key attributes to increasingly digital solutions. Here are some examples noted in the Halliburton, second quarter conference call- “Interventionless” is the key term I've bolded in the above statement. Interventions are expensive shutdowns of producing wells that often require a rig-a big expensive piece of machinery. They can be done rigless, but that's an outlier. In this case the company is describing smart equipment that will remotely engineered solutions can fix itself. How will this work? Researchers and engineers from both companies will leverage and optimize Microsoft technologies in machine learning, augmented reality (AR), user interactions and Industrial Internet of Things, as well as Azure’s high-performant infrastructure and built-in computing capabilities to deliver tightly integrated solutions across the energy value chain. Areas of collaboration include  As a first step in the alliance, Halliburton has made its DecisionSpace® 365 available on Azure, enabling real-time data streaming from IoT edge devices in oilfields and the ability to apply deep-learning models to optimize drilling and production to lower costs for customers. Using the power of DecisionSpace® on Azure, big computing and predictive deep-learning algorithms will help optimize field assets and enable next-generation exploration and deep-earth models by using software to fill gaps in sensor data, while reducing the number of steps and time required to render models.  Related: Oil Drops As Demand Recovery Stalls Nagaraj Srinivasan, senior vice president of Landmark and Halliburton Digital Solutions, commented in a recent press release from Microsoft-
 “Halliburton is at the forefront of the digital transformation occurring in the E&P industry. We believe open architecture and community-based innovation are necessary to drive this fundamental change and we’re proud to work closely with an industry leader like Microsoft to deliver tailored E&P digital business solutions to our customers across the globe.” Source Depth correlation is one of the most problematic scenarios in the oilfield. I can remember being shut down for hours as wireline was rigged up to confirm firing depth for guns (Hey, in the shallow GoM where the sand interval between shale strata can be 5-feet total), prior to perforating. Or is my packer-a zonal isolation device, where it needs to be to land out my completion string? Questions like this have to be answered, and Halliburton is doing this without the mechanical risk-you don't always make it out the hole with everything that goes in. In the oilfield the term ""fishing trip,"" doesn't have pleasant connotations. Source  Mechanically set packers run on pipe or wireline have been the standard for the industry for decades, as changing the circulation path was also mechanical process. Pushing a button to set, reset or shift this tool has been a dream of the industry. Not having to move the tool is a critical step change improvement, capable of saving 10’s of thousands of hours of lost rig time globally. Your takeaway The oilfield will be a smaller place in the decades to come. Companies like Halliburton will have to adapt from the old model of spending huge sums of capex and hiring tens of thousands of employees. The model of the future will be one where AI leverages the power of fewer employees to control the production of smarter machines, and hopefully generating improved returns on capital invested.

Jet Fuel Crisis Will Hurt Oil Demand For Years To Come.html,"A very slow recovery in jet fuel demand will drag on global oil demand for at least another two years as overall passenger traffic numbers continue to be low and mandatory quarantines continue to stop people from traveling on international flights.   Demand for gasoline has picked up from the lows in April when most of the world was under lockdown, but demand for jet fuel continues to languish and is expected to grow only marginally next year from a very low base in 2020, analysts and international agencies say.   A full recovery in jet fuel demand will probably have to wait until 2023, Bank of America (BofA) said in a recent commodities research report cited by The National. The third quarter of 2021 will see the first meaningful rebound in jet fuel demand, before global demand returns to the pre-crisis level of around 8 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2023, according to the bank. ""The only way out of this for jet fuel seems to be a cure or a vaccine for Covid19,"" The National quoted BofA as saying. Vaccinating most of the population will likely take years, and vaccinating 2 billion people in the developed countries and China alone could take up to a year and a half, the bank says. And that assumes that a vaccine is indeed rolled out sometime next year, as reports suggest. And that's not a certainty.
 Recovery in the jet fuel segment will be the slowest and will lag a recovery in oil prices, according to BofA analysts. Domestic passenger traffic in some countries such as China is up from the lows earlier this year, but international air travel continues to face headwinds as a resurgence in coronavirus cases brings back some restrictions that could discourage travel on commercial flights. The UK, for example, ordered again on Sunday a 14-day self-isolation for travelers returning from Spain after a spike in COVID-19 cases in several Spanish regions, including in the city of Barcelona.  Related: Oil Drops As Demand Recovery Stalls Even in Asia, jet fuel refining margins slipped in the past week amid weak demand, and a trader in Singapore told Reuters that ""The jet fuel market in Asia is still very volatile. Any strength in demand is not sustainable."" Jet fuel is and will continue to be the worst-hit fuel in the pandemic, and second-wave or not, it is expected to take much longer to recover to the pre-COVID-19 levels than other fuels, Rystad Energy said in its latest oil demand projections.
 Jet fuel demand will only partially recover next year, rising by just 800,000 bpd from this year's low levels, as international travel will continue to be under pressure for the entire 2021, OPEC said in its first look into 2021 oil demand. Overall global oil demand is expected to rise by 7 million bpd in 2021, after an 8.9-million-bpd drop this year, the cartel said in its July Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR). The International Energy Agency (IEA) sees global oil demand rising to 97.4 million bpd in 2021, compared to an estimated 2020 demand as of July at 92.1 million bpd. Average global oil demand next year is expected to be 2.6 million bpd below the 2019 level with jet fuel/kerosene demand accounting for three-quarters of the deficit, the IEA said in its latest Oil Market Report this month. In the United States alone, jet fuel consumption is down by 31 percent, or by 540,000 bpd, this year compared to the 2019 average of 1.2 million bpd, the EIA said in its July Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). Globally, ""although EIA expects steady increases in consumption of gasoline and diesel in the second half of 2020, forecast jet fuel consumption remains weak as EIA expects the recovery in air travel to lag behind the recovery in road travel in most countries,"" the administration said. A second wave could stall the very fragile recovery in jet fuel demand if more countries impose mandatory quarantines and self-isolation for passengers arriving from countries with resurging COVID-19 cases. Although jet fuel demand accounts for just around 8 percent of global daily oil demand, the recovery lagging other fuels will continue to be a drag on total demand recovery.",-0.9946,negative
Can Oil Save Ecuadors Economy.html,"For decades, oil rich Ecuador proved to be a risky and unprofitable jurisdiction for foreign companies seeking to tap its vast mineral wealth. This peaked with the $9.5 billion court ruling against integrated international energy major Chevron in 2011. The tribunal alleged that Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2000, had for three-decades pumped petroleum waste into waterways around Ecuador’s northern Amazonian city of Lago Agrio. The judgement, which a U.S. court found to be a product of fraud, did considerable harm to Ecuador’s reputation as a destination for foreign investment. That combined with significant controls on capital, excessive taxation of profits and an opaque regulatory environment significantly deterred foreign investment in Ecuador’s commodity sector. This has prevented Quito from fully exploiting and benefiting from the Andean country’s considerable natural resources. A perfect storm of sharply weaker oil prices, aging infrastructure and excessive debt is crushing Ecuador’s oil dependent economy.   By the end of 2019, Ecuador’s financial crisis was so severe that Quito decided to withdraw from OPEC allowing it to avoid the cartel’s mandatory production cuts. Early last month the Andean country’s central bank forecast that Ecuador’s economy will shrink by a worrying 7.3 percent to 9.6 percent during 2020. That along with sharply weaker oil and onerous levels of government debt forced President Lenin Moreno’s administration to negotiate with bondholders to avoid a sovereign debt default. Oil’s latest price crash is a major contributor to Ecuador’s dire economic state. By 2019 petroleum and mining generated just over 6 percent of the oil dependent economy’s GDP compared to 12.5% in 2013 when the last oil boom peaked. Crude is the Andean country’s primary export responsible for 35 percent of its total exports in 2019. The financial impact of substantially weaker oil prices is magnified by Ecuador’s inability to boost production despite vast oil reserves of over 8 billion barrels. While Ecuador, unlike its neighbor Colombia, has considerable proven oil reserves estimated at 8.3 billion barrels, it is struggling to grow production. That could be blamed on regulation which disincentivized foreign investment in Ecuador’s hydrocarbon sector and the constraints imposed by OPEC’s production cuts. Quito has taken significant measures to boost oil output. The key one of those was leaving OPEC to avoid compliance with the cartel’s mandatory production cuts which would have limited plans to boost Ecuador’s oil output.  Related: Oil Prices In Limbo As Fears Of A Second COVID Wave Grow Aside from quitting OPEC, Moreno’s administration is focused on reforming the Andean country’s hydrocarbon sector and reversing the policies of resource nationalism enacted by his predecessor Rafael Correa. It was during the latter’s tenure that Ecuador’s reputation as a difficult and unprofitable jurisdiction for foreign energy companies arose. That can be squarely blamed on Correa’s interventionist approach to managing Ecuador’s copious natural resources. During his presidency onerous taxes as well as unfavorable contracts were imposed on private oil companies and there were even instances of asset seizures.
 Crucial improvements made by the Moreno government are the reintroduction of participation contracts, improved profit-sharing arrangements and reduced taxes for energy companies. The restoration of participation contracts is especially important because it allows private petroleum explorers and producers to book oil reserves. That allows them to be more easily valued in accordance with industry methodology and access reserves-based lending, making all-important capital more accessible. Those measures send a signal that Ecuador is open for business and is ready for more oil exploration and production activity. This has already sparked an uptick in interest from foreign oil companies. In early 2019, foreign oil companies including Geopark, Frontera and Gran Tierra acquired interests in the Intracampos blocks located in in the Oriente Basin in northeastern Ecuador near the Colombian border. Intracampos Blocks Ecuador  Source: Ecuador Ministry of Energy and Non-renewable Natural Resources. Quito’s reforms point to a brighter long-term outlook for Ecuador’s economically vital petroleum industry, although foreign investment may not occur as rapidly as needed.  While Moreno’s administration has overturned his predecessor’s policy of resource nationalism, there is still a long way to go to convince foreign oil companies that Ecuador is open for business. This is reflected by the World Bank’s Doing Business 2020 report where Ecuador received an extremely low rating, ranked 129 out of 190 countries, indicating that it remains a risky jurisdiction for foreign energy companies. It is Ecuador’s high levels of state interventionism that were identified as a key hazard. The latest oil price slump is amplifying Ecuador’s unattractiveness for foreign oil companies. In response to the March 2020 oil price crash and considerable uncertainty triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, oil companies around the world slashed spending and shuttered non-essential and uneconomic operations. It is investment in exploration and development activities in higher risk jurisdictions which is the most adversely affected.
  Related: Oil Drops As Demand Recovery Stalls Aside from elevated political risk, Ecuador’s relatively high estimated breakeven price of $39 per barrel, a mere $2 lower than the current market price, is further deterring investment. This is further exacerbated by Ecuador’s main Napo and Oriente oil blends being benchmarked to West Texas Intermediate rather than Brent. That prevents companies pumping crude in Ecuador benefiting from Brent’s premium price, which is roughly $2 per barrel higher than WTI.  Recent severe civil unrest, pipeline ruptures and the heavy impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ecuador are also ratcheting up risk for foreign oil companies. These events are all preventing Quito from growing Ecuador’s oil output and achieving its 2020 target of 590,000 barrels daily. Aging infrastructure is also weighing on Quito’s oil ambitions. Multiple April 2020 pipeline ruptures caused oil production to plunge to a low of 68,000 barrels daily, reducing the monthly total to 225,242 barrels daily or less than half of March’s 539,629 barrels. It took until May 2020 for repairs to be completed and pipelines to reach full operational capacity, which saw that month’s output rise to an average of 333,339 barrels daily. It wasn’t until June when production reached full capacity averaging 514,863 barrels daily which was 3 percent lower than the equivalent period in 2019.  For these reasons, Quito will not achieve its all-important goal of boosting oil production to an average of 590,000 barrels daily. That will impact Ecuador’s oil dependent economy worsening the fiscal crisis gripping the Andean country. It will take some time for Quito’s reforms to the petroleum industry to be recognized and attract the much-needed investment to head-off the growing crisis.",-0.9921,negative
Oil Prices In Limbo As Fears Of A Second COVID Wave Grow.html,"Oil markets sent some mixed signals last week as bullish and bearish data continued to influence prices. The COVID-19 situation in the United States raised some uncertainty over the prospects of demand recovery, while the announcement of a vaccine by the University of Oxford provided significant price support and optimism.  A 2nd wave of COVID-19 may be on the horizon  Markets were increasingly concerned about a 2nd wave of COVID-19 over the past week as data reflected a sharp rise in the number of cases. We have always been very cautious about raising our demand forecast during the 2nd half of 2020. Rystad Energy now forecasts demand in 2020 to stand at 89.7 million bbl/d while considering a 2nd wave as a base scenario, which is 0.65 million bbl/d below our forecast, and significantly less than the latest forecast of OPEC, IEA, and the EIA. Yet the impact of a 2nd wave on global demand is not expected to be as bad as the first demand shock last April as the world is far more prepared to handle lockdown measures in a more local manner. Yet, the impact may continue to weigh on crude markets in 2021 and beyond as fuel demand continues to suffer due to movement restrictions. Deteriorating US-China relations continue to weigh on the markets 
 The deteriorating relationship between the United States and China continues to weigh on the global markets. Last week, the US government ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, accusing it of spying activities under the guise of diplomatic work, while China retaliated by ordering the United States to shut down its consulate in Chengdu. Furthermore, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States and the introduction of lockdown measures in some states led to rising concerns about the speed of demand recovery in the world’s largest petroleum consuming economy. According to John Hopkins University, the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States exceeded 4 million, with 15.4 million cases confirmed globally. In addition, 1.42 million US citizens have filed for unemployment benefits over the past week. The US President issued a warning that the COVID-19 crisis is likely to worsen, harming the US economic recovery. It is expected that the US congress will agree on a new stimulus package as extended unemployment benefits will expire at the end of the month. Concerns over the US economy led to a weakening US dollar, reflected by the US dollar index which closed at 94.38, down by 1.57% w/w. However, a weaker US dollar has encouraged buying of dollar denominated commodities including oil and gold which have become more affordable to holders of other currencies. Gold rose to historical levels trading above $1900 last week, which was mainly driven by the ongoing US-China political tension, fears of a global recession and a weakening US dollar.   Related: Is The Bottom Finally In Sight For U.S. Drilling Rigs? Price spike was not only due weakening US dollar, but also bullish demand sentiment  In what can be seen as bullish news for oil markets, EU leaders have agreed to a 750 billion economic stimulus for the euro-zone. In addition to this, the University of Oxford has announced promising results from its vaccine clinical trials suggesting that the vaccine could be introduced by September. These bullish factors have contributed to a price spike in Brent and WTI which traded above $44 and $41, respectively, last week. If the vaccine proves to be successful, the potential impact on the global economy would be dramatic, as shown by the sharp rise in prices last week.  Additional bearish data from the United States with rebounding drilling activities 
 Bearish data last week came in the form of a slight rise in the U.S. oil rig count, which capped the rally last week. The U.S. oil rig count rose to 181 active oil rigs, up by 1 rig w/w. Drillers were incentivized the rise in WTI crude, which has been holding above $40 over the past couple of weeks. We expect a further increase in U.S. oil rigs over the next few weeks as prices continue to rise. Furthermore, the EIA reported a rise of 4.9 million barrels w/w in the commercial crude inventories. Although this was less than what was reported by the API (7.9 million barrels), it raises serious concerns about the recovery in oil demand. Next to the rise in crude inventories, the EIA reported a decline in gasoline stocks by 1.8 million barrels w/w, and a rise in distillates stocks by 1.1 million barrels w/w. U.S. refinery runs declined to 14.206 million bbl/d, down by 103 thousand bbl/d w/w signalling a decline in fuel demand due to new lockdown measures in some states. Additionally, U.S. crude oil production rose to 11.1 million bbl/d, up by 0.1 million bbl/d w/w. Bearish inventory data led to Brent closing the day lower last Tuesday and Wednesday. In the light of a slow economic recovery, we currently expect prices to be limited not only by staggering demand in the United States, but also by a rise in U.S. drilling activity and a rebound of production rates. ",-0.9351,negative
Trump Heads To Texas To Discuss US Energy Dominance.html,"President Donald Trump is visiting Texas this week, to raise money for the Republican Party and discuss the country’s energy-dominance agenda with the local oil industry. Trump’s energy agenda was one of the cornerstones of his campaign and, according to observers, secured him many votes from the oil and gas—and coal—industry. Initially defined as an energy security agenda, during Trump’s term, it became an energy dominance agenda as the second shale boom pushed U.S. crude oil production to the highest ever, turning the country into the largest producer of the world’s most traded commodity.
 However, the second shale boom turned out to be a double-edged sword when the oil market swung into an oversupply yet again, with the coronavirus outbreak decimating demand. The federal administration had worked to achieve energy dominance by “cutting regulations, simplifying permitting and encouraging private investment in energy infrastructure,” according to a White House statement cited by the AP. This approach was maintained during the crisis, with Washington refusing to mandate production cuts for private producers as OPEC+ had asked. As President Trump said at the time, the market would take care of itself. Indeed, while no official cuts were made, Washington undertook to shoulder some of the production cut burden OPEC+ had negotiated with Mexico after an agreement of historical proportions was reached among all the big oil producers in the world this spring. And then U.S. producers started cutting back on production simply because oil prices were too low to break even. At one point, WTI and several other U.S. benchmarks swung deep below zero as traders rushed to offload their positions.
 Right now, the energy dominance agenda may be a little compromised because of the unprecedented change in demand for oil and gas resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Indeed, the pandemic will continue to threaten Trump’s agenda, according to experts, just as it threatens the global economy, with uncertainty marring any outlook for even the short term.",0.4191,positive
The Second Wave Of COVID Wont Crush Oil Markets.html,"As Covid-19 infections continue to increase around the world and the implications of the pandemic’s spread are acknowledged in key markets in the Americas and Asia, Rystad Energy is now changing its base case scenario for oil demand, incorporating a mild second wave effect. The updated base case scenario assumes a temporary pause in global demand recovery, as the reopening of Europe and other regions is offset by Covid-19 outbursts in populous and high oil-consuming countries in the Americas and Asia such as the United States, Brazil and India, among others. There is downside risk to our base case. We have identified a category of oil demand at risk – that is, the maximum number of barrels that could be lost if a full lockdown is reinstated globally. In this worst-case scenario in which strict lockdown measures return, we expect demand to edge around 3.7 million bpd lower for the rest of 2020, compared to our updated base case scenario. Even if the disease is not reined in and this full-blown second wave manifests, the effect on oil demand will not be as destructive as during the first shock in April 2020. That is because the world is better prepared to introduce smarter and more targeted lockdowns, handle infections, and also because the global economy can simply not afford another steep economic meltdown. In this update, instead of gradually recovering monthly, global oil demand in our base case is now expected to stay relatively flat from July to October 2020 and then inch up again from November, albeit at a much slower rate than previously estimated. In July, oil demand is now expected to average 90.2 million barrels per day (bpd) and then improve to an average of 90.6 million bpd for August, September and October. In November, oil demand is likely to reach 93 million bpd and in December climb a bit more to 94.7 million bpd – still a far cry compared to the pre-Covid oil demand average level of more than 99 million bpd in 2019.  Related: Tropical Storm Hanna Threatens Texas Oil Industry
 The mild second wave is expected to last into January and February 2021. From March 2021 onwards, our updated base case scenario does not diverge from our previous base case that did not incorporate a second wave.  On an annualized level, the updated base case scenario shows global oil demand is now forecast to reach 89.7 million bpd in 2020 and 97.1 million bpd in 2021. “We do not expect full demand recovery in 2021 as structural growth drivers are still not set to snap back. Furthermore, some fuels remain marginally depressed, with aviation activity not fully recovering before the end of 2022, when, in the best case, oil demand will approach pre-virus levels,” says Rystad Energy’s senior oil markets analyst Artyom Tchen. The halt in demand recovery in our updated base case scenario is predominantly due to a slowdown in road fuel demand from August, which otherwise enjoyed a big boost in July.
 While in June road diesel landed 2.57 million bpd lower than our pre-Covid-19 estimates, it picked up in July and will lag only by 1.56 million bpd. Similarly, road gasoline landed 2.61 million bpd lower than our pre-pandemic estimate in June and will only trail by 1.71 million bpd in July. From next month though, our current base case shows that this demand gap against our pre-virus estimates will widen again.   The above gap for diesel will reach 1.63 million bpd in August, 1.73 million bpd in September and 1.82 million bpd in October, before shrinking to 1.49 million bpd in November and 1.34 million bpd in December this year. For gasoline, the gap will reach 2.04 million bpd in August, 2.01 million bpd in September and 1.92 million bpd in October, before closing to 1.57 million bpd in November and 1.40 million bpd in December. It is worth noting that jet fuel is not expected to follow a similar path, as airlines have implemented strict measures and are slowly but steadily restarting disrupted flight routes, providing some summer transport relief for healthy passengers. The gap between the current demand estimate and our pre-Covid-19 projection for jet fuel reached 4.94 million bpd in June, will land at 4.77 million bpd in July and will be shrinking for every single month until the end of 2020, according to our updated scenario. That said, jet fuel is the fuel currently most hit by the pandemic and, as mentioned earlier, it will take a much longer period to fully recover. In the grim case of the full-blown second wave lasting from Aug-20 to Oct-20, there will be long-lasting demand impacts that carry into 2021 and beyond.",0.3025,positive
Big Oil Braces For Brutal Earnings Season.html,"The oil majors are set to unveil their second-quarter earnings in the coming days, and analysts expect the figures to be pretty rough. Despite their size, the integrated oil majors are slated to post huge losses.  The problem is that there is almost nowhere to hide. Oil prices were obviously at historically low levels in the second quarter, including a brief trip deep into negative territory. Typically, during downturns, the majors are shielded by their downstream refining assets – low crude prices lower input costs and cheap fuel tends to stoke demand.  However, the pandemic obviously shut everything down, so demand contracted sharply. With hundreds of millions of people confined to their homes, it didn’t matter if fuel was cheap. As a result, refining margins collapsed.  So, too, did petrochemical demand. Chemical units were unlikely to bolster the battered finances of the oil giants. Meanwhile, the global market for LNG has also plummeted. Natural gas has been another segment in which the oil majors are betting their future growth. But Covid-19 has ravaged gas markets as well.  Perhaps the numbers won’t be as bad as expected. On Friday, Equinor posted a surprise profit, earning $350 million in adjusted earnings. That was down nearly 90 percent from a year earlier, but it beat expectations.  There are a few caveats to these seemingly better-than-expected numbers. The Norwegian company said that it performed better not because of its oil and gas production, but in part because it profited from trading. “While the strong trading result was positive, we believe this should not be extrapolated,” DNB Markets said in a note to clients.
 Another glaring issue is that Equinor has not adjusted its long-term oil price assumptions. While BP and Shell announced massive impairments – $17.5 billion and $15-$22 billion, respectively – the Norwegian oil company avoided taking any write-downs by leaving its oil price assumptions unaltered. Equinor is counting on a Brent price of $80 per barrel in 2030. The company said it would update this assumption in the third quarter, so any potential write-downs will come later.   Related: Tropical Storm Hanna Threatens Texas Oil Industry To its credit, Equinor cut its dividend earlier this year, the first large western oil company to do so. That eased the cash flow pressure.  The upcoming earnings figures could result in more announcements like that. Analysts are anticipating a dividend cut from BP. The aforementioned writedown made huge news a few weeks ago. The British oil company has also announced in June that it would lay off 15 percent of its workforce, eliminating 10,000 jobs.  Earlier this year, BP made headlines when it said that it plans on overhauling operations to become a much lower-carbon energy company over time. Maintaining a hefty dividend would require piling on much more debt, which would hamper the company’s transition plans, analysts say. 
 Meanwhile, ExxonMobil and Chevron have refused to cut their dividends. Chevron just bought Noble Energy in a high-profile deal that expands the company’s footprint in U.S. shale and the Eastern Mediterranean. ExxonMobil, meanwhile, is sticking with its aggressive growth plans in the Permian and Guyana.  The strategy will surely lead to more debt. The oil majors took on $80 billion in debt in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg. That will allow them to maintain their respective strategies for a little while longer. But more debt carries the risk of credit rating downgrades. Exxon, for instance, added $8.8 billion in debt in the second quarter and is on track to increase debt to $78 billion by the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs.  Exxon also has refused to write down assets, a stubbornness that has earned it quite a bit of criticism. Particularly in the context of uncertain long-term demand, Exxon’s refusal to acknowledge the risk seems to be untenable. But we will learn more in the coming days if the oil majors plan on making any change in direction.",0.4273,positive
Brazils Oil Giant To Boost Production At Deepwater Field.html,"Brazil’s state-held oil firm Petrobras launched on Friday a tender for three new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSOs) units for one of the largest deepwater oilfields in the world, Búzios, as part of a development plan to have the field pump more than 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). The tender for the three new FPSOs is part of Petrobras’ plan to have a total of twelve units installed at the Búzios oilfield by the end of this decade, the Brazilian oil firm said in a statement on Friday. Once development is completed, the Búzios field is expected to produce more than 2 million boed, becoming Petrobras’ largest production asset.
 The field currently has four operational FPSOs. The first of the three new units will be the FPSO Almirante Tamandaré with startup scheduled for the second half of 2024, while the other two units, P-78 and P-79, will be contracted under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) model and are expected to start operating in 2025. FPSO Almirante Tamandaré will have a daily processing capacity of 225,000 barrels of oil, while the other two will have the capacity to process daily 180,000 barrels of oil each, Petrobras said.   Petrobras also aims to make better use of the associated natural gas in its prolific oil-rich pre-salt area by having offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) units to process the gas, whose production has been rising with growing oil output in the area.  
 Offshore LNG liquefaction could be a solution to the associated gas from oil fields 100 miles off the coast and could reduce flaring, Viviana Coelho, Corporate Emissions and Climate Change Manager at Petrobras, said at a webinar earlier this month. Petrobras currently ships the natural gas produced in the pre-salt area via pipelines to the coast, where it is processed. In the past, the Brazilian oil firm has said that insufficient infrastructure for natural gas production could limit its efforts to boost crude oil output in the pre-salt area.   ",0.9423,positive
Is The Bottom Finally In Sight For US Drilling Rigs.html,"Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the number of oil and gas rigs in the US fell again this week, by 2, to 251, marking the twentieth straight loss in the number of active rigs. The total oil and gas rigs are now sitting at 695 fewer than this time last year. The number of oil rigs increased for the week by 1 rig, according to Baker Hughes data, bringing the total to 181—compared to 776 active rigs this time last year.
 The total number of active gas rigs in the United States fell this week by 3 rigs, landing at 68 total rigs. This compares to 169 rigs a year ago. To compare active rigs with supply figures, the EIA’s estimate for oil production in the United States rose for week ending July 17—the last week for which there is data, to 11.1 million barrels of oil per day. While this represents a 100,000-bpd increase from the week prior, oil production in the United States is still 2 million bpd less than the all-time high for US production. Canada’s overall rig count rose this week by 10, settling at 42 active rigs. Oil and gas rigs in Canada are now down 85 year on year.

Tropical Storm Hanna Threatens Texas Oil Industry.html,"Tropical storm Hanna is expected to make landfall in Texas on Saturday with heavy rains that could result in flash flooding along the Texas coast, where oil refineries and LNG facilities are located. Early on Friday, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its 7 a.m. CDT advisory that tropical storm Hanna was about 285 miles east of Corpus Christi, with gradual strengthening expected until the tropical cyclone makes landfall. Hanna is expected to produce rain that may result in life-threatening flash flooding, rapid rises on small streams, and isolated minor to moderate river flooding in south Texas. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the mouth of the Rio Grande to San Luis Pass, Texas. According to Philip Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University specializing in Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane forecasts, Hanna has formed in the Gulf of Mexico and is the earliest 8th Atlantic named storm formation on record. The previous record was Harvey in August 2005.
 The Atlantic hurricane season comes as emergency services in Texas are overstretched with the spike in coronavirus cases in the state and other U.S. states. Another tropical storm, Gonzalo, has already formed and is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to the southern windward islands on Saturday, the NHC said. At the start of the hurricane season, companies operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico evacuated workers from oil facilities ahead of the storm Cristobal. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for some 17 percent of U.S. oil production. In 2018, hurricane Michael shut in production of more than 700,000 bpd for a few days.

Oil Traders Discount Crude As Chinese Demand Weakens.html,"Oil producers such as Iraq, Russia, and the UAE are lowering their crude oil prices to make it salable as demand from Asian buyers remains lukewarm, Bloomberg reports, citing traders. The most recent instance is two cargoes of Iraqi Basra Light, which BP and China National United Oil Corp. had to sell at steep discounts for lack of willing buyers. Before that, Russia and UAE crude cargos had to be discounted to find buyers.
 The news is worrying because most recent reports about China and oil have been optimistic, including news of record refinery runs and equally record import levels. In the past few days, however, other reports have started to emerge, suggesting that the hunger of the world’s largest oil importer for the commodity may be waning. Chinese oil buyers have been stocking up on dirt-cheap crude since the early days of the global health crisis, which pushed prices even lower than the Saudi price war. But what starts must come to an end, especially when storage capacity is finite and fuel demand on the domestic market is not recovering as quickly or strongly as many may have hoped for.
 While some China observers with expert knowledge about the country’s energy industry have argued that China can stretch its storage to soak in more crude, it is by no means endless. And if imports are rising more quickly than local fuel demand, then this storage space would be filling up, reducing Chinese buyers’ appetite for crude. This is bad news for large oil producers, which had pinned their hopes on China, In the Middle East, Bloomberg reports, producers including Iraq and UAE had even raised their official selling prices for August in anticipation of an increased appetite from China. What they are getting, however, is the opposite. Bloomberg notes that private refiners are starting to reduce their run rates after the record-high rate of 14.08 million bpd recorded for June. State refiner Sinopec is also cutting run rates because of flooding in the Yangtze River.",-0.9703,negative
The Quiet Destruction Of Colombias Shale Oil Potential.html,"Sharply weaker oil prices, falling investment and dwindling oil production are weighing heavily on Colombia’s economic outlook. Last decade, the strife-torn Andean country bet its economic future on oil and became Latin America’s third-largest oil producer. A combination of deteriorating oil production and low reserves, despite promising estimates of the Andean country’s oil potential, weigh heavily on Colombia’s economy.  By the end of 2019, Colombia’s proven petroleum reserves were a mere two billion barrels giving the country around six years of oil production. Those inadequate reserves, a lack of recent major hydrocarbon discoveries and the country’s economic dependence on petroleum hastens the need for Latin America’s third-largest oil producer to boost its oil reserves.  In response to the dire outlook for Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector and to stave-off a looming economic crisis, President Ivan Duque’s administration is focused on expanding crucial petroleum reserves and production. In November 2018, Duque stated Colombia needed to double its proven reserves by adding two billion barrels of oil to remain energy self-sufficient and maintain economic growth. Aside from attempting to attract additional foreign investment through financial and regulatory concessions, Bogota is pushing for the commencement of unconventional (hydraulic fracturing or fracking) petroleum exploration and production. Nevertheless, the government has found it extremely difficult to get fracking off the ground since attempting to initiate various pilots almost a decade ago. Considerable public opposition to fracking exists in Colombia. The controversial method for extracting oil from shale formations has been repeatedly blocked by Colombia’s courts on public health and environmental grounds, despite the decade long U.S. shale oil boom operating safely.  Toward the end of 2018, Colombia’s highest administrative court the State Council placed a moratorium on fracking. Then in a surprise move, in 2019 the tribunal ruled that the temporary moratorium “does not impede the development of comprehensive investigative pilot projects.” This breathed life into the government’s and state-controlled Ecopetrol’s plans to initiate fracking pilots. Earlier this month, Duque issued Resolution 401850 establishing the technical criteria for the fracking pilots.  Related: Is Nuclear Energy Making A Pandemic Comeback? The key target of unconventional oil and gas exploration in Colombia is the La Luna geological formation in the Middle Magdalena Valley. The Valley, one of Colombia’s most prolific oil basins with over 41 fields, is thought to hold up to almost two billion barrels of conventional oil reserves.  Middle Magdalena Valley and Geological Boundaries.   Source: National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH).
 Industry insiders and analysts compare the La Luna formation to the prolific U.S. Eagle Ford shale, which sees the geological body estimated to hold up to 10 billion barrels of oil. If true and correctly exploited, that would significantly boost Colombia’s proven oil reserves, alleviating the considerable economic hazards posed by the Andean country’s insubstantial oil reserves, short production life, and deteriorating oil output. Middle Magdalena Valley Schematic Cross Section.  Source: National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH). Exploration activities, including appraisal drilling targeting the La Luna formation, have previously taken place on the VMM-2 and VMM-3 unconventional oil blocks in the Middle Magdalena Valley. They are 80% owned by international oil major ConocoPhillips with the remaining 20% interest belonging to Canacol, Colombia’s largest independent natural gas producer.  Middle Magdalena Valley Blocks VMM-2 and VMM-3.   Source: ConocoPhillips Colombia.
 Despite oil discoveries and appraisal wells having been drilled, operations are suspended on both blocks pending the receipt of environmental permits from Colombia’s National Environmental Licensing Authority (ANLA Spanish acronym). The required permits to continue activities on those blocks probably won’t be available until the fracking moratorium is overturned, which appears some way off.  This may be too little too late when the latest oil price collapse is considered and harsh operating environment for energy companies are considered. That price crash sparked massive spending cuts by oil companies around the world. Colombia’s five largest petroleum companies, which control 99% of the Andean country’s oil production, Ecopetrol, Frontera, Parex, Geopark and Gran Tierra responded to sharply weaker oil by slashing spending on exploration and development. This will cause crucial investment in Colombia’s oil industry for 2020 to fall from the $5 billion originally estimated by the National Hydrocarbon Agency (ANH Spanish acronym) to below $4 billion, which is less than 2019.   Related: Renewable Energy Is Seizing Market Share During The Pandemic For those reasons, the current difficult operating environment will stymie Colombia’s unconventional oil ambitions. Even efforts by the ANH to ease the regulatory burden won’t attract the required investment. Sharply weaker oil prices and the considerable risks involved with fracking in Colombia make investing in unconventional oil projects highly unattractive and hazardous. The lack of confidence among foreign oil companies for investing in Colombia is amplified by the substantial security risks that exist. By the end of May 2020, there had been 27 attacks on oil pipelines by various illegal armed groups. Of greater concern is the June 2020 attack on Ecopetrol’s La Cira-Infantas oil field in Colombia’s primary oil-producing region the Llanos Basin. That worrying event saw 42 wells attacked taking up to 35,000 barrels of daily production offline and causing localized oil spills. Those events point to the considerable animosity that exists among Colombian communities toward the hydrocarbon sector, as well as the appreciable security risks associated with operating in the strife-torn country. There is considerable public disquiet over fracking in Colombia, including substantial unease regarding the potential for water contamination and methane emissions. This is generating significant fear of unconventional oil operations, despite the U.S. history of oil extraction by hydraulic fracturing demonstrating that environmental and health risks can be suitably managed if appropriate resources are available. If fracking is eventually approved in Colombia, the lack of social license and intense opposition will see the oil companies engaged in unconventional oil operations become targets for protests from community groups and environmentalists. That will also make them attractive objectives for Colombia’s last remaining guerrilla group, the ELN, and other illegal armed groups. Shifting regulations, an unclear legal environment, and community disapproval of fracking make unconventional oil operations in Colombia an unappealing and hazardous investment. This is magnified by elevated security risks and low oil prices, making it uneconomic as well as highly unattractive for oil companies to invest the considerable capital required. While the commencement of unconventional oil exploration and fracking pilots in Colombia could resolve the Andean country’s energy and economic woes, they are proving increasingly elusive. This is ratcheting up pressure on Colombia’s government which is facing what could be the country’s worst economic crisis of modern times.",-0.9915,negative
Is This The Worlds Riskiest Oil Frontier.html,"Somalia’s government has announced that it would hold its first-ever offshore licensing round this August, marking the starting point of Africa’s perhaps most adventurous oil frontiers. Still recovering from the disastrous consequences of the Civil War, Somalia currently produces no oil whatsoever and has no exploratory activity taking place. This does not hold back the federal government from dreaming big and claiming that Somalia might be Africa’s last passive giant frontier. Somalia has heretofore seen only 2 offshore wells and neither of them was drilled in deep water, hence the authorities are fully entitled to promote their offshore as an untapped bounty waiting to be discovered. Were Somalia to be the last gem of Africa, could it really handle such a windfall? The federal government of Somalia, active since 2012 after almost 30 years of sanguinary civil war, will offer 7 blocks within the 1st Offshore Licensing Round (blocks 152, 153, 164, 165, 177, 178 and 204). This is less than half of what the Somali government initially wanted to put on offer – the price plunge and across-the-board CAPEX cuts have curbed the investing appetite of international majors, hence the modified offer. It was assumed that the totality of 15 blocks that Somalia intended to license out to oil companies had a resource potential of some 30 BBls, based on seismic testing done by the Norwegian geophysical company TGS. The Jurassic separation of Somalia and the Madagascar-Seychelles-India block has seemingly created oil-prolific deposits that share many characteristics with the Ogaden Basin and partially also the Rovuma Basin. Despite harboring aspirations to join the East African exploration drive for quite some time, Somalia did not have petroleum legislature regulating the industry up until February 2020. By ratifying the new Petroleum Law, the fully state-owned Somali National Oil Company (SONOC) was created to spearhead the launch of production and the Somali Petroleum Authority (SPA) was established to oversee the process from a regulatory point of view. Somalia has opted for flexible upstream terms, whereby the royalty rate would fluctuate between 5% and 35% depending on the price of oil, along with a profitability-based profit-sharing scheme. On paper the suggested fiscal terms look reasonable, the question is whether they would stay the same if yet another political crisis compels the federal government to generate cash out of somewhere.

  Source: Petroleum Economist. Somalia has one of the most contorted historical legacies to overcome, not to speak of unsettled maritime border disputes with neighboring countries, primarily Kenya. Oil exploration in today’s Somalia has started in the 1950s, with companies like Sinclair, AGIP (now ENI) spudding wells in British Somaliland, with the overwhelming majority of wells drilled onshore. It seemed that first drilling results delivered promising results yet they did not materialize into commercial projects, therefore then-majors have continued assessing potential deposits in the 1960s, moving towards the tip of the Horn of Africa. Sinclair’s Agfoi gas discovery, located near the capital of Mogadishu was the pinnacle of the initial exploration drive. Agfoi, however, turned out to be another commercial failure as the field never went further than being a mere prospect.  Related: Renewable Energy Is Seizing Market Share During The Pandemic
 Just as international majors, spearheaded by Shell around the Mogadishu are and ENI around the tip of the Horn of Africa, started to try their luck with Somalia’s offshore in the 1980s, the onset of the civil war forced everyone to evacuate and effectively freeze Somalia’s oil prospects. Interestingly, the Somali government has reached out to majors that were active in its offshore – in March this year it has even signed a preliminary road map with Shell and ExxonMobil on their return, claiming that they are entitled to continue assessing their respective pre-1991 concessions. For this to happen, Exxon and Shell have paid $1.7 million owed to Mogadishu for the lease of their offshore concessions. Choosing only 7 concessions for the 1st Offshore Licensing Round is a politically wise move, as not everyone is satisfied with the prospect of Somalia producing oil. First among them is Kenya which still has an unsettled maritime border dispute with Somalia – none of the blocks on the offer are within the disputed territory yet Mogadishu might still have to wait for the final decision of the International Court of Justice (referred to ICJ in 2014). As it happens, a decision favorable to Somalia would deal a double blow to Kenya’s upstream plans – as opposed to Somalia it has offered out acreages in the disputed zone. Total has already relinquished Block 22, partially located in the disputed area, so now the Italian ENI remains the only international major with disputed acreage. Where does this leave Somalia’s offshore future? Between a rock and a hard place, that is certain. Although the federal government has passed legislation on revenue-splitting with its regions (states), the percentage that the government would keep is still unsettled, leaving ample space for regional surges of discontent. Moreover, despite providing attractive fiscal terms there remains little confidence that in a country that for decades embodied the term “failed state” the federal authorities could uphold a rule of law adequate enough to keep the oil contracts intact. Somalia has taken several good steps towards creating a sustainable oil and gas framework yet the fragility of the Somalian state and concerns about it falling back into a ceaseless battle royale loom large over its long-term prospects.",0.8811,positive
Permian Leads Recovery As Frackers Ramp Up Activity After Oil Crash.html,"The Covid-19 downturn has caused a shocking decline in new fracking operations in the US, with monthly numbers plunging to a bottom of just 325 wells in June. A Rystad Energy analysis shows that new operations are now set to rise to above 400 wells in July, and recovery will be especially evident in the Permian Basin, where activity has nearly tripled. Rystad Energy’s well count comes from both our own satellite data analysis and from our tabulation of FracFocus numbers. Our satellite data shows 246 newly started frac jobs this month, with 96 frac jobs beginning just last week. “While there is only one week left in July, the availability of data varies across the tens of thousands of locations covered, with a possible reporting lag temporarily concealing additional fracking activity. We therefore estimate that the final July frac count might surpass 400 wells, and will return to levels last seen in April 2020,” says Rystad Energy’s head of shale research, Artem Abramov.  The magnitude of the frac activity recovery in the Permian, in comparison to other oil basins, has become much more evident. As of 22 July, we have identified 125 started frac jobs in the Permian for July. This activity is 15% to 23% higher than the well count for the full months of May and June 2020. On average, the Permian Basin has higher satellite revisit rates than other oil basins. This means that while other oil basins might also see recovering activity, the estimates around these recoveries are more uncertain.  Related: Halliburton Looks Beyond Shale As Fracking Remains Unprofitable The running rate of frac activity in the Permian has shifted from 15 to 20 wells per week in May and June, to 40 to 45 wells per week in the last three weeks. Last week, week 29, activity was particularly strong with 63 started frac operations based on our preliminary estimates. This level of activity has not been seen in the Permian since early April this year. In all other oil basins including Bakken, Eagle Ford, Anadarko and Niobrara, our latest fracking activity estimates suggest fracking activity is around 35 to 40 wells per week since the beginning of July. Meanwhile, we estimate that 20 to 25 wells per week are currently being fracked in gas basins, which represents a significantly reduced activity level compared to the levels seen at the beginning of the year. On the rig front, US land rig activity in oil basins seems to have hit rock bottom as the count of horizontal oil-focused rigs declined by one more rig last week, falling from 157 rigs to 156 rigs, a decline which originated from the Permian. Other oil basins saw a net zero change in the number of active rigs, as the addition of one rig in Eagle Ford was offset by a rig count decline in central Texas.
 Gas-focused drilling saw another week of declines, decreasing from 63 active rigs down to 59. Most of these declines came from the Utica part of the Appalachian Basin, but Haynesville also lost one rig. The cumulative decline in horizontal oil rig count, which began in the middle of March, has now reached 75%. However, the magnitude of weekly declines in the recent weeks has slowed considerably. The two-week decline rate peaked at 25.6% at the beginning of May 2020 and has now slowed to 3.1% by the middle of July. “We anticipate nationwide horizontal oil drilling will remain relatively flat in the next few weeks, as some operators continue to implement modest downward adjustments, while others have started restoring drilling operations in the current $40 WTI price environment,” adds Abramov.",0.6432,positive
US Shale Output Set For Another Slide As New Well Drilling Stalls.html,"Despite the fact that U.S. shale producers have brought back a quarter of the output they had curtailed, production is set for a new slump after the summer as new well drilling has ground to a halt and won’t be able to sustain output levels, analysts and oil executives told Reuters. U.S. oil firms are estimated to have curtailed around 2 million bpd of crude oil production in May after prices plunged and demand crashed in the pandemic. By early July, producers had restored some of the production, estimated at around one-quarter of the curtailments. Houston-based Noble Energy plans to bring back by the end of July most of the oil production it had curtailed in the second quarter.
 In the middle of June, Continental Resources – which had shut in 70 percent of its output – said it expects to partially begin resuming production but still expects to curtail approximately 50 percent of its operated oil production. ConocoPhillips also said in June it expects to start bringing back in July part of the oil production it had curtailed in Q2.   Although some of the production is coming back online, the nature of the shale wells, whose initial production rates drop by around half after the first year, means that production increases require constant drilling of new wells.

The U.S. rig count saw its nineteenth straight week of declines last week.
 Drastically reduced drilling activity likely means that U.S. oil production could take more than two years to return to the pre-crisis levels. “Shale is not broke; shale is not gone; shale will come back,” ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance told IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin for ‘CERAWeek Conversations’ last month. “But I do think it comes back slower because there's going to be pressure on companies to confine their capital program, maybe not grow dramatically as they were before, because I don't think the access to capital in the investor community, at least in the public side of the business, is going to be as robust as it was over the last decade,” Lance added.",0.9325,positive
